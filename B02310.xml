            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AT this time, in which all that comes from Pen or Pulpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Popery,</hi> is of ſo good Coyn with PROTESTANTS. that they have Re-printed a late in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe more the Ignorant People,) a little Book bearing for the Title, <hi>A New Method, &amp;c.</hi> I have reſolved to put an Anſwer of it to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Altho' it pleaſes the Author to call it New, I ſcarce find any New thing in it; it containing hardly any thing
<pb facs="tcp:175808:3"/>which has not been Objected and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. His turn indeed from the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Religion to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> was then New, but it, and all its Circumſtances being of ſmall or no importance to the publick. I take no notice of it.</p>
            <p>For the Dogmatical part of his Book, ſince he runs through allmoſt all our Articles, endeavouring ſo to blemiſh every one with his Pen, that his Book ſeems more to be a Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Libel, then a Confutation of our Religion, I have thought it was not amiſs to give it ſuch an Anſwer, as might be both a Solution to what is Objected, and an Explanation of our Tenets in that manner, that it may appear how much they wrong us, when the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Religion is repreſented to the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as groundleſs and full of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
            <p>And for this latter Reaſon, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb facs="tcp:175808:3"/>Reader, you will excuſe me, if I am a little longer then ſeem'd to require the Anſwer of ſo ſmall a matter. To make my Work leſs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to thoſe who will do me the Honour to Read it. I have divided the whole into ſeveral Chapters, Sections, and Subſections, with Titles relating to their different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOu are the Great Reaſoners of this Nation, our Wiſe Kings have judiciouſly ſet you on your Seats
<pb facs="tcp:175808:5"/>with Power to bring other Men to Reaſon. Wherefore I hope you will not take it ill, I beg your Patronage and favourable Look, upon a Book which defends it ſelf, not ſo much by Authority as by Reaſon. Paſſages from the Holy Fathers it backs by Reaſon, to Paſſages of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſubmits with Reaſon, for Faith is Superior to Reaſon, and Reaſon it ſelf tells us, that to Faith we muſt ſubmit our Reaſon. Would we think that Man reaſonable who would doubt to ſubmit his Reaſon to God the Principle of Reaſon?</p>
            <p>God will and ought to be Worſhiped our Nature and Reaſon tells us; but how, we know not, unleſs he himſelf reveal it. Some thought the Deity they acknowledged was to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped with the Sacrifice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the Burning of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as ſome <hi>Pagans.</hi> In the Old Law they thought God was to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd by the Sacrifice of Beaſts: But
<pb facs="tcp:175808:6"/>in the New we abhor ſuch Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> among Chriſtians offer him daily the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his <hi>Son</hi> Incarnate: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> condemn this Sacrifice, and content themſelves to Honour him with the improper Sacrifice of their Prayers, and of ſorrow for their Sins.</p>
            <p>From this Variety of Judgement in Men as to the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Let us Reaſon, <hi>My Lords,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is not at preſent content to be Worſhiped by any of theſe waies I pleaſe, for one diſallows the other, Judging it abominable.</p>
            <p>If the Spirit of God moves me to one of theſe in particular, the ſame Spirit cannot move another to abhor my way of Worſhip and condemn it, and if it be the true Spirit that moves him who condemns me, 'tis not the true Spirit by which I am moved, ſo that its impoſſible for Man to know by which way he ought to turn himſelf to God without a Revelation.
<pb facs="tcp:175808:6"/>You ſee then 'tis but Natural to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from him, and that we would be all at a ſtand without it.</p>
            <p>We find in our ſelves a violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Luſt, Intemperance, and other Evils; lay aſide the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Original Sin the cauſe of theſe Diſorders, to whom ſhall we aſcribe it? Shall we ſay, that God, who made our Nature and all that is in it, implanted in us theſe vitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations? No. They are Motions contrary to the Motions of his Spirit, a Law contrary to the Law of God, they formally oppoſe his Sanctity, and contradict him, ſpeaking to us by Reaſon, <hi>Rom. 7.23.</hi> They cannot be then from God, but from whom elſe we had not known, had we not had a Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>When we following our Appetites have worked againſt Reaſon, Reaſon tells us, we have offended the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Giver of our Reaſon, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in what manner we ought to
<pb facs="tcp:175808:7"/>make amends we know not without a Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> Chriſtians then unanimouſly conceive that God has revealed both what he would have us Believe of him, and what he would have us do to ſerve him. And hold that all thoſe Divine Truths are ſhut up in a Book we call the Bible. <hi>We</hi> all run to this Book, earneſt to know what is our Duty to God, which is indeed as the wiſe Man ſaies <hi>omnis Homo,</hi> and without which in Truth, <hi>nihil eſt omnis Homo.</hi> But who ſhall Interpret this Book to us? <hi>We</hi> ſee our greateſt Divines cannot agree among themſelves in the ſenſe of it, how ſhall meaner Capacities hope to underſtand it? When we are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in our underſtanding of a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and which miſunderſtood is our Deſtruction, <hi>2 Petr. 3.16.</hi> Who ſhall be our Judge to ſet him who is wrong, right, and ſo compoſe our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? The Scripture it ſelf by a conference of Paſſages?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:175808:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>My LORDS,</hi> I appeal to your Wiſdom and your Knowledge of the Duty of a Judge or a Man in your Station. Is it not the part of a Judge ſo to give Sentence that all preſent may know who of the two Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties is in the right, or who is in the wrong, according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Sentence? But after the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſaid all it can to our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Men, after they have conferred Paſſage with Paſſage in the Vulgar and Original Tongues, Prayed &amp; uſed what other means you pleaſe, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſubmiſſion to an Infallible Church. Neither of them will avow that he is condemned by Scripture; then Scripture alone cannot be our Judge, nor does God himſelf by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone decide our differences. In the mean time without a Judge we are all looſe in our Opinions. Hence Confuſion, Fire, Sword, Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Church, and Diſſention among the People to the Deſtruction of the
<pb facs="tcp:175808:8"/>Nation. And what is the buſineſs? What is the Quarrel? They won't ſubmit their Judgment to mine: To yours? And why ſhould they ſubmit their Judgment more to yours, than you to theirs? Who thinks himſelf to be void of wit, or not to abound in Judgment, <hi>quiſquis in ſuo ſenſu abundat,</hi> and if it be true that there is no Infallible Viſible Judge, why may not <hi>I</hi> hope that God gives me as much of his Divine aſſiſtance as to you, ſince I uſe as much diligence as you to obtain it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My LORDS,</hi> do you ſee where we are? What would the Law Book do in <hi>Scotland</hi> if your Lordſhips Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were not impowered and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to determine Cauſes. What Cauſe does not find an Advocate to make the Law look favourably upon his Clyant? Will we make God leſs wiſe to keep an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his <hi>Church,</hi> than Kings to keep an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in their Kingdom? A
<pb facs="tcp:175808:8"/>Holy King moſt earneſt to have Juſtice adminiſtred to his People, if it were in his Power, and he could with his eaſe enlighten his Judges with Truth, in giving their Sentence, would he not do it? Does not God as earneſtly deſire, as that Holy King, that all Men come to the Knowledge of the Truth in matters of Faith, if we may believe <hi>St. Paul, 1 Tim. 2. v. 4.</hi> And cannot he, if he pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty enlighten his Church and influence Her with an Infallible aſſiſtance in Her Deciſions? Why then ſhall we not think he has done ſo? Since he has eſtabliſhed Her to Govern us, <hi>(Act 20.28.)</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected us to Her Obedience, <hi>(Matth. 18.17.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What do I ſay, ſhall we not think he has done ſo? Can a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally doubt yet of it after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſaying to Her, <hi>Who hears you hears me,</hi> (Luc. <hi>10</hi>) and after St. <hi>Paul's</hi> aſſuring us, <hi>(Eph. 4.)</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi>

            <p>And who can but waver and be ready to hearken to others who ſpeak with more applauſe (if he Judge his Fore Teachers Fallible,) in the great and laſt concern of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
            <p>Grant this, <hi>My LORDS,</hi> which is evident enough, that the Teaching <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> whereſomever She be, is Infallible in Her Deciſions of Religion, and the main Work is done, for we will as eaſily find Her out by Her Marks ſet down in the Holy Scriptures, as the Sun among the Planets, <hi>in Sole poſuit Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculum ſuum,</hi> (Pſal. <hi>18.</hi>) he has made Her as Viſible as the Sun.</p>
            <p>What is unreaſonable in all this Diſcourſe? But if the great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of looking ſtrange on us, be the imagined difformity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> be pleas'd to caſt your Wiſer Eyes
<pb facs="tcp:175808:9"/>upon this little Book, and with your Reaſon examine impartially the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we bring for the <hi>R. Catholick Religion.</hi> If here and there our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeem to contradict your ſenſes, 'tis to obey Faith, to Her, according to <hi>St. Paul, Rom. 1. v. 5. We owe Obedience;</hi> and ſuch, that we muſt ſometimes captivate our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this performance, <hi>2 Corin. 10. v. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, Reaſon is the Light of Man, but Faith is the Light of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> To be a Man I muſt be Rational, but moreover I muſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have the Title of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> God has given us both our Will, and our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. He will (and with all Reaſon) be Honoured, by the one aſwell as by the other.</p>
            <p>I Honour him with my Will when I Obey his Law, I Honour him with my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding when I ſubmit to Faith, and ſeek no other evidence than his Word for all I Believe in order to
<pb facs="tcp:175808:10"/>my Salvation. As my doing, (what otherwaies pleaſes not my Nature,) becauſe God commands it, is a perfect ſubmiſſion of my Will to his command, ſo my Believing, what God reveals to me by his <hi>Church, (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies I don't underſtand,)</hi> is a perfect ſubmiſſion of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Word.</p>
            <p>A Word worthy of our Adoration. God by the force of his Word Created us, by the bounty of his Word Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and by the Submiſſion of our Judgment to his Word, revealed to us by his <hi>Church,</hi> expects to Save us. Otherwaies not, <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> all that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,) <hi>ſhall be Damned</hi> undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, Mark <hi>16.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> know <hi>My Lords,</hi> that if a Man find himſelf convinced to become a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> at this time, the very fear of being thought to turn upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gaining or continuing in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is no ſmall Stumbling-Block to
<pb facs="tcp:175808:10"/>Perſons of Honour: But if you have ſtrong Reaſon on your ſide, what Reaſonable Man can wonder? Should not they rather wonder, to ſee you <hi>(Men before in their Opinion ſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> now fail and fall from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or of ſo little reſolution, as to leave an infinite Good, for a Good that is ſo finite, ſo ſmall, I mean a conſervation of eſteem among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>Of this laſt I thought good to mind your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> in my great Zeal for your Souls, and high reſpect for your Perſons coveting to be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

Is it credible, ſay I, that this Science with all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and afforded Light ſhould not help, but rather remove us from our end? If ſome ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighted People think She moves more doubts, then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175808:14"/>She ſatisfies with Her Solutions; The fault is in their weak ſight, or tainted underſtanding, not in Divinity. As when in ſome, the Ill affected Pallate loaths Meats, which otherwaies are moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>Anſwer to what is Objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> R. Catholick's <hi>Practical or Moral Divinity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUr Adverſary condemns our Moral as too large, and giving too much way to the Corruption of Nature. So heretofore the Phariſees condemned the Moral of CHRIST, becauſe he, who came to Save what had periſhed, converſed with Sinners, and Cured them on the Sabbath. If among us ariſe ſome Children of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity who with the ſubtilneſs of their wit endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to elude, and betray the ſimplicity of the Law, they, as unfaithful Stewards, are removed from the care of Souls, and their dogmes branded with ſhame, a ſign to the Faithful, that their wild Opinions are to be avoided as poyſonous Herbs to the Sheep of CHRIST. Thus you ſee their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy in their Sentiments brings no blot on the Moral of the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Another aſperſion he endeavours to fix upon our Moral, by a way of ſpeaking, he ſaies, he heard among Catholicks, viz. <hi>That Men of wit do not Sin.</hi> Their Reaſon is, ſaies he, that every Sin, for example, Adultery may be conſidered as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Act, and as an Act unjuſt: If you conſent to it as a natural Act, you incur no Sin, if as to an Act unjuſt, you Sin.</p>
                  <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, There is no Man ſo dull in Spirit or obdur'd in Conſcience, who does
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175808:15"/>not ſee he incur's the Guilt of Adultery, when he conſents to do the natural Act with knowledge of Injuſtice, <hi>viz.</hi> in that circumſtance of another Man's Wife, inſeparably adhearing to it.</p>
                  <p>For otherwaies, not only every Adultery would not be a Sin, but 'twould be alſo impoſſible to commit a Sin in Adultery. Which I ſhow thus: I cannot in that imaginary Opinion commit a Sin in Adultery, unleſs I will the Act of Adultery as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, but this I cannot do, becauſe to will the unjuſt as unjuſt, reſting there, is to will <hi>malum qua malum,</hi> or <hi>evil as it is evil,</hi> which is not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Proſecution, or of the will ſeeking, but only of flight or of the will abhorring and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now if theſe familiars of our opponent avow it impoſſible to commit a Sin in Adultery, one may think 'twere more likely to meet with them in <hi>Bedlame</hi> then in an Univerſity.</p>
                  <p>In fine, I preſs him further, and ask, if, what he utters in general, was not apply'd by the ſpeaker to the matter of Uſery in particular, if ſo, I avow that the Ignorant ſometimes may Sin in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the knowing Man would not Sin. As when the Ignorant really ſuffering damage by the lending of his Money intends, and takes Sinfully ſomething more then what he lent, purely for the uſe of it, as Uſerers are wont to do. Which, if he had been a knowing Man, he might have Lawfully taken for his ſuffering damage in the lending of his Money, or ſome other Lawful title unknown to the Ignorant, but known to him.</p>
                  <p>Nay, That I may Charitably ſuſpend the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of our Adverſary as the Relater of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, I give yet this ſenſe to his ſaying, <hi>witty Men Sin not.</hi> That is to ſay, when Actions indifferent as to their Object, have the ſame Phiſical Effect,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175808:16"/>whither I do them with a Good or Ill Intention, for Example, a Cup of Wine equally ſtrengthens my Body, whither I drink it meerly out of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, which is a Sin, or becauſe it pleaſes God I refreſh my Body with it to be more able to ſerve him, which is a vertuous Action, the truly witty Man, who is ordinarily mov'd by Eternal Reaſons. chuſes to pleaſe God by the latter intention and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors to Sin by the formet.</p>

                  <p>OUr Adverſary ſayes that there are only two things neceſſary for Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> To live a Life conform to the Law of God. And to Obey Humane Power deriv'd from Him: But theſe two things are fulfill'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> then they may be Sav'd.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part he proves by the publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175808:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>uſe they make of the Holy Scripture, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they take from thence the ſubject of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſcourſes, Meditations and Inſtructions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their whole Life to its Model.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer</hi> by this their aſſiduous uſe of Holy Scripture, they with the light, they think they have from God above other Men, find it is impoſſible for any meer Man to keep God's Commandements, or to live a Life conform to the Divine Law; yet our Adverſary gives us this for a mark that they are in a Saving Way, becauſe they Actually live a Life conform to the Law of God. I need not tell you that theſe two propoſitions cannot ſtand together. If you deny the former, you diſcredit the <hi>SCOTS Catechiſm,</hi> and the torrent of <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> If you diſallow the latter, our Adverſary's Proof is lame of one Foot; let us now ſee if it can ſtand on the other. The great Reformer <hi>Calvin,</hi> not to ſpeak of other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> holds that the Laws of Men are nowiſe oblidging in Conſcience. <hi>Nunc,</hi> ſaies he, L. 4. Inſtit. c. 10. n. 5. <hi>ad humanas leges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deamus: Si in hunc finem latae ſint ut Religionem nobis injiciant quaſi per ſe neceſſaria ſit earum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatio, dicimus conſcienciae imponi qued fas non erat,</hi> now <hi>(ſaies he)</hi> let us return to Humane Laws, if they be made on the account of binding us in Religion, we ſay 'tis a reſtraint lay'd upon our Conſcience which was a thing Unlawful to do. <hi>Neque enim cum hominibus ſed cum uno Deo negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt Conſcientiis noſtris.</hi> For the buſineſs of our Conſcience belongs to God alone and not to Men. How is then the obſervation of them, one of the two things neceſſary to Salvation? Which was the ſecond part of his proof, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are in a ſaving Way. You ſee our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is here quite of his Feet, the firſt of his proof
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175808:17"/>failing by <hi>Proteſtant's</hi> Confeſſion, and the other being of no force as a matter indifferent to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To riſe up again, and get favour at leaſt. If he can't credit, with thoſe of his Faction to make us Odious, he ſaies that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not of that Opinion of ſome <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Pope</hi> has a Power to depoſe a King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I avow ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not of their Sentiment the difference between them and thoſe <hi>Catholicks</hi> is this, that the Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay it but faintly, <hi>cum formidine de oppoſito</hi> with fear that the contrary Opinion be true. But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who hold a depoſing Power, hold it ſtrongly, undoubtedly with a ſecure Judgment of the goodneſs of the Action, having confirmed it by publick Authority of Church and State, and a legal proceeding, as was ſeen in the Bloody depoſing of CHARLES <hi>the firſt</hi> our Lawful Soveraign. I grant the Loyal party now has a Horrour of that depoſing Power. But it muſt be confeſſed the Royal party it ſelf had not that horrour when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they depoſed in like manner Queen MARY <hi>of Scotland</hi> Lawful Heir of that Kingdom.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Proteſtants <hi>are in a worſe condition than thoſe who never heard of</hi> CHRIST.</head>
                  <p>OUr <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> advances an other proof to ſhow that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can be Sav'd, <hi>God,</hi> ſayes He, <hi>illuminates all Men that come into this World, Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>v</hi> 8. then he adds, are not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They are Men, and illuminated by God, but if they reſiſt this Light which is given them, and equivalently tell God, as thoſe wicked Men of whom <hi>Iob</hi> ſpoke, <hi>Iob.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam viarum tuarum nolumus, We will not have the knowledge of thy Wayes.</hi> They will be found more remote from Heaven, then, if they had not receiv'd it.</p>
                  <p>He urges we <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> grant that Infidels who have never heard of CHRIST may be Sav'd and inconſequently deny that hope of happineſs to <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There's no ill conſequence here to deny a capacity of Salvation to him who puts a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to it, and to grant it to him, who puts none. The Infidel who hath never heard of CHRIST, doing what lyes in him by living according to the Light of Nature, make's way to Grace. But the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> who rejects Faith offered to him by God and his Church, willingly ſhuts up the avenue to a further Grace, and untill he remove this obſtacle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175808:18"/>by an humble ſubmiſſion of his Judgment to Faith, he continues in an impoſſibility to pleaſe GOD.</p>
                  <p>O! <hi>but you are uncharitable, ſayes He,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſimple People, that <hi>a Proteſtant</hi> can't be Sav'd.</p>
                  <p>I ask him, can <hi>a R. Catholick</hi> be Sav'd? If he ſaies, no, where is his Charity for us? If he affirms, we may, then they who according to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are Idolaters may be Sav'd. If ſo, whom will you exclude from Heaven?</p>
                  <p>But to return to his Objection, ſince he denies Charity to us, and we only Faith to him, Charity being a greater Vertue then Faith according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is not he in this more Uncharitable to us, then we to him?</p>
                  <p>He goes on, do not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals contained in the three Creeds and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, ſince that there are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals as condiſtinguiſhed from Intigrals, or not Fundamentals, is a Fundamental point with him; I ask, in what CREED, or <hi>Book</hi> and Chap. of Scripture is this Fundamental contained? If he can't find this; then that hereafter he ſpeaking with <hi>Catholicks</hi> may diſtinguiſh a Fundamental from an Integral, as he calls it. Let him take this notion of a Fundamental from us, <hi>to wit,</hi> that all things contained in Holy Scripture are Fundamentals in this ſenſe, that we are bound to believe them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Damnation, when they are ſufficiently propos'd to us by the Church, as reveal'd by God in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>For to diſbelieve God revealing that Chriſt me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175808:18"/>we perfectly diſtinguiſh the Faithful foul from a Infidel or Sectarian. And therefore it is not given without ground or reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Again when Chriſt commanded the Goſpell to be preached to Men, did he command the things only which you call fundamentals, to be Preach'd, or the whole Goſpel. if things only you call Fundamentals, why were the Apoſtles ſo exact to give us the whole Goſpel, that it's thought Damnable not only to add, but to pair from it? If he commanded the whole Goſpel to be Preached, and conſequently to be believ'd, how can he be ſav'd, who refuſes to believe the leaſt Integral of it when it's ſufficiently propoſd to him as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed by God.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. <hi>The formal</hi> Proteſtant <hi>cannot be ſav'd.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALtho he thinks he has won the cauſe by his laſt Argument, yet he brings another to prove that a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> nay a formal <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may be ſav'd. And to prevent our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he ſayes, that <hi>R. Catholicks,</hi> as he was taught diſtinguiſh the formal <hi>Proteſtant</hi> from the material, in this, that the material is in an invincible Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the formal in a vincible Ignorance. But before he goes further, I muſt tell him that he is either ſhort of Memory, or that he took ill up his Leſſon of the formal Hereticks. For <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Divines, teach not that he is a formal Heretick, who lives in a vincible Ignorance, altho' groſly culpable, and affected too, if he be not pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but he only is a formal Heretick who with obſtinacy defends an Errour.</p>
                  <p>Hence St. <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 162. ſpeaks thus. <hi>Qui ſententiam ſuam quamvis falſam atque perverſam nulla pertinaci animoſitate defendunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>parati corrigi cum invenerint veritatem, nequaquam ſunt inter Hereticos reputandi,</hi> id eſt, <hi>Who defends their Opinion, tho falſe and perverſe, but without any obſtinacy ready to ſubmit when the Truth ſhall be ſhown them, are not at all to be counted Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when our Adverſary tells me that a formal <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> may have ſtronger Arguments (<hi>viz.</hi> as they appear to him,) againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:175808:22"/>then for it, he is in an invincible Ignorance and ſo may be Sav'd. I infer from that antecedent, not, <hi>and ſo may be Sav'd.</hi> But, <hi>and ſo is only a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> Proteſtant, according to the notion of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <hi>Proteſtant</hi> given, and agreed upon by our Adverſary, and ſo indeed the material <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may in this caſe be Sav'd, not the formal. But, then he will tell you there is no formal <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> for who knowing his Error defends it, is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, &amp;c. not a True <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There are likely many ſuch among thoſe who paſs in the eſteem of their Brethren for true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> Men, I ſay, carried away either by Paſſion or Intereſt to ſpeak againſt their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As among <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> there are but too many, who are led by Intereſt or Paſſion to do that which they know to be Damnable and againſt their Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And now not to ſpeak of thoſe who have been, and are known to be of this Category, I bring you a Reaſon for the proof of what I have ſaid, which is this. It's certain all the Arguments, <hi>R. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> bring for the proof of their Religion, are not clearly and with full ſatisfaction ſolv'd by <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> or elſe why would ſo many of their Learn'd Men, as I could Name ſome, come to us for Truth's ſake, not only without any Humane inticement, but on the contrary with great Worldly prejudice, and renouncing of natural ſatisfaction, which is not remark'd in our Learn'd People going to them, when their Lives, after they have left us, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be true that our Arguments are not fully ſolv'd by them, many of their Learn'd Men muſt ſee this, as I was told of a Miniſter in <hi>France,</hi> (when I was among the <hi>French</hi>) who, when his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:175808:23"/>Wife ſtartl'd by what he uttered in a Diſcourſe, ſaid to him after, if that be true, why do we live as we live? He anſwered Her, <hi>Que Diable veut tu que je faſſe avec toy &amp; mes Enfans,</hi> that is; <hi>What the Devil wilt thou have me do with Thee and my Children?</hi> To wit, if he Liv'd according to what he thought. Thus they ſeeing the <hi>R. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Truth, and Teaching Proteſtancy are formal <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who as long as they remain ſo, cannot be Sav'd.</p>
                  <p>Many of the material <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, it may be, much held in their way by the Phyſical Arguments, they frame to themſelves againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this depends much of the notion of a Body which hath been given them in Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>For, if they have been taught, for example, that the nature of a Body conſiſts in an actual extenſion of its parts, and that accidents are not diſtinct from the ſubſtances; it preſently appears to them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the whole <hi>Body of CHRIST</hi> can be in every the leaſt particle of the Hoſt, and there under the ſole Accidents of Bread.</p>
                  <p>But we <hi>Catholicks</hi> when we ſee ſuch notions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with what the Holy Scripture ſaies, the Holy Fathers unanimouſly teach, and the whole Church hath believed from the Apoſtles time down to us; we condemn them, knowing that Reaſon muſt captivate it ſelf to Obey Faith, not Faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her ſelf to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Don't think for what I have ſaid that I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a material <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> who has no doubt in his Faith ſecure as to his Salvation, no; I do not indeed deny but that he may be Sav'd, but I do not abſolutely ſay that he will be Sav'd, for he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great changes in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion ſince
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175808:23"/>its riſe, the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> alone remaining alwayes the ſame, ſeeing Preachers who were thought Learn'd and Good-men, and who had ſtood ſtiff to the Covenant as conform to the Word of God, now ſolemnly renounce it, acknowledging they have got a new Light, he can't I ſay well, but doubt, whether he ought to follow them in this Light, or in the Light for which they ſaid before as much, as for this.</p>
                  <p>And ſince they changed from the former, it may be hereafter they will change from this to a third, there being no more infallibility in this, then in the former. And if he doubt, he is bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and hearing, that the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Church believes Her ſelf to be infallible in what She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Infallibility, if it were true, being (as confeſs'd by all) a certain means to ſettle Men in Conſcience, and ſecure them from all doubts in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he is bound to enquire, and try if <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> have any ſolid ground to bring for this their Tenet, and if he find it good, in Charity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he's bound to embrace it.</p>
                  <p>Next, tho' a material <hi>Proteſtant</hi> have no doubt, he is not in an equal condition in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe if he fall into grievous Sin, he has no other Remedy then an Act of Contrition, or of Sorrow for it, purely for the Love of God, he has offended, which is not ſo eaſily had. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Catholick</hi> has frequent Sacramental Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and by it pardon from God, which is clearly intimated to us, in <hi>Io.</hi> 20. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 23. <hi>The Sins which you remit are remitted to them.</hi> A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may ſay I believe from that paſſage it not ill, but Lawful to Confeſs to a Miniſter of the Church, but not that we are bound.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:175808:24"/>
                  <p>But weigh then, ſay I, the following Words, <hi>Whoſe Sins you retain</hi> (or do not pardon) <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> (are not pardon'd;) this can't be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Excommunication, for if you don't, or can't pardon, with what Authority do you, or can you retain? Both parts belonging to the Function of the ſame Miniſters of God. Alſo the Excommunication is not a formal retaining of Sin, but a thing deſtinct, and a ſign of your retaining it, poſterior to the retaining of it. Moreover, how can the Prieſt know which Sin he may remit, and which he muſt retain, if you do not Confeſs them to him?</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in Confirmation of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſayes, in his 49. <hi>Hom.</hi> of the 50. <hi>Hom.

                  <p>Theſe People conſcious to themſelves of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid or vicious Life, in the Religion they were in, ought not to ground themſelves upon their want of doubt in the way they have taken, but to uſe much humble Prayer to God to enlighten them.</p>
                  <p>Here I add ſomething our Adverſary ſaies, to juſtifie himſelf, in a Letter to a Friend, <hi>Sure I am,</hi> ſaies He, <hi>that a knowing Man, as one may have Reaſon to think me to be in ſuch matters, can never reſiſt a known Truth. So if I be in an Error, 'tis not an Error of Will, but Iudgement, for which God damns no Man, provided this Error be invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, as undoubtedly mine is, allowing what your prepoſſeſſion inclines you to believe, that I am really miſtaken: There being an invincible Error, but leſs reflected on, that comes from knowledge as well as an other more talked of in the Schools, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from want of knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Did not <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> reſiſt a known Truth? If not, why were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? If they did reſiſt it, may not you alſo? Were they leſs knowing than you? Or leſs Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Moral Life then you? One fault was found in them, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Judgement to the Church. And this is found in you.</p>
                  <p>Tho' God damns no Man for an Error of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He may damm a Man for the Sin, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh which, he withdrew his Grace, and for want of which Grace, this Man ſell into that Error of Judgement. So a drunken Man Dying, tho' he is not Damned for what proceeds from Drunkeneſs, for a Blaſphemy uttered in that time, yet he may be damned for the Sin, which brought him to this diſtemper of his Reaſon.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:175808:25"/>
                  <p>Neither flatter your ſelf with an invincible Error proceeding from knowledge, there is no ſuch; an Error of Judgement is an Ignorance of Truth, and therefore that Error proceeds from Ignorance, and not from knowledge. A Fool upholding his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion againſt a number of Wiſe Men, thinks this his. Opinion proceeds from his knowledge, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have not, and that he ſpeaks with a great deal of ſenſe. In the mean while, the Wiſe Men preſent, pitty him, ſeeing all he ſayes is but non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and that all this Diſcourſe, in which he runs out, proceeds from his Ignorance. So that what he eſteems in himſelf to be Light, is truely Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AFter our Adverſary had endeavoured, tho', as I hope you have ſufficiently ſeen, in vain to prove poſitively that Proteſtants may be ſav'd in his ſecond <hi>Sect.</hi> pag. 43. His aim, is here to prove the ſame negatively <hi>i.e.</hi> that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:175808:25"/>in their Religion there is no hinderance of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Two things only, as he Imagins; may hinder from Salvation, Schiſm and Hereſie. But <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are free from both; then they have no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of Salvation, as he concluds. Schiſm, ſaies he, is a ſeparation from the true Church, and the true Church is that of primative Chriſtians. We, grant all this. But Proteſtants do not differ from the primative Chriſtians, this we deny. And this which he ſhould have chiefly proven, and one which lyes the whole force of debate between him and us, he paſſes over, and ſlips away, ſaying, it has been proven by others. This way of proving is indeed a new method, but not infallible. For, why ſhall I believe him that others have done that which he with all their Light given him and his own dar'd not undertake to do himſelf? Since he then could not prove that Proteſtants do not differ, from the primative Chriſtians, I will not content my ſelf to ſay that others have proven that they do differ, but I will prove it to him.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that Chriſtians in the third age (I go no farther then the bounds he allows me) did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the ſecond, nor the ſecond from the firſt in their rule of Faith, and this ſuppoſed, I ſay.</p>
                  <p>Proteſtants now have not the ſame Rule of Faith which Chriſtians had in the firſt three Ages, then they differ from them. The Rule of Faith among thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Chriſtians was the Holy Scripture as interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, not the Scripture as interpreted by every private Mans beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which is the Rule now among Proteſtants refuſing to ſubmit to any Counſel, or Synods interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a paſſage of Scripture, if their Judgment ſtand againſt it. The Diſciples of Chriſt, englightn'd as they were, did not underſtand the Scriptures before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:175808:26"/>Chriſt opened 'em to them, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> Vicar of Chriſt in that function explaining the Scripture to thoſe of his time, told them, it did not belong to any private Man to Interpret it, 2 <hi>Petr.</hi> 1 <hi>v.</hi> 20 and Inſtanced that many had wreſted or miſs-Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Words to their own Deſtruction. 2 <hi>Petr.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. CHRIST ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> feed my Sheep, not with Bread, but with Doctrine. As, I cannot Feed that Child, who willfully refuſes to open his Mouth to receive the Food, I offer him, no more could <hi>Peter</hi> Feed thoſe Chriſtians with Doctrine, had they refuſed to open their Ears, and to bear it with ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Chriſtians then wiſely ſubmited to <hi>Peter;</hi> and their followers to his Suceſſors being of an equal power to Inſtruct them; for Chriſt promiſing to be with his Apoſtles to the end of the, World did not mean with their Perſons only, who were not to exceed a hundred Years, but alſo with thoſe of their Lawful Succeſſors. And ſo the perpetual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church hath been to have recourſe in Controverſies of Religion to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> it being neceſſary, as St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaid in the 2. Age for all Churches, to have their recourſe to her.</p>
                  <p>Next to prove to me that the Proteſtants do not differ from the Primative Chriſtians, you muſt not only ſay, but ſhow me that your whole Church, not only ſome private men, takes the Scripture in the ſame ſenſe, their whole Church or lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church took it in.</p>
                  <p>Show me ſome General Counſel of yours or a Body of Paſtors, to which you all unanimouſly ſubmit, and then I will underſtand what your Church holds, otherwayes not. And becauſe you will not ſubmit to any ſuch Body, I can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how you agree with the Chriſtians of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative times.</p>

Here you are at a ſtand. And I alſo; For if you don't aſſign me them, how ſhall I know that in them preciſely you all agree. Beſide moſt of the Articles of thoſe Profeſſions are meer Negatives of <hi>Catholick</hi> Articles, unknown, (as you ſay, not I,) to the primitive Chriſtians; and I ſay, if they did not know thoſe our Articles, neither had they a knowledge of the Negations of them, which is poſterior to the knowledge of the things of which they are Negations. And ſo not knowing thoſe your Articles they did not in them agree with you.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> ſay you, cannot ſay that they agree with the Chriſtians who liv'd in the firſt three Ages, becauſe they have brought in many Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unheard of to them. As the Invocations of Saints, Adoration of the Holy Hoſt, Veneration of Pictures, and the Popes power, in order to teach us what we ought to believe, for if you mean of the depoſing power, you know, tho' ſome <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> hold it, none is bound to believe it, ſince the Church hath not defin'd it.</p>

                  <p>You ſay its certain that ſtanding to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals we are Guilty of a Superſtruction. I ask once again what theſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity are? That every one may ſee clearly whither, or no, what I hold as a Tenet of Religion, is not found among them, but is a meer ſuperſtruction. Will you refuſe to a conſiderable Perſon, who thinks certainly he has ſeen in the Law Book, a Law which juſtifies the Action for which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to Die? Will you, I ſay, refuſe him a publick ſight of that Book, to juſtifie your Sentence againſt him, but, notwithſtanding the murmur of the People upon your refuſal of his demand ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Innocent, ſavagely caſt him?

                     </head>
                     <p>I Ask our Adverſary, did thoſe Chriſtians living then, believe as a Fundamental point, that they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175808:27"/>were the true Church planted by CHRIST, and continued from the Apoſtles, or not? If not, then they could not ſay in their Creed, <hi>I believe in the Holy Catholick Church.</hi> If they did believe it, I ask again upon what ground was truth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to them, for three hundred Years, and not to the Church till the end of the World? Was not Gods promiſe of Infallibility to his Church, made to it as well to the end of the World as for the firſt three hundred Years, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>This is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord, my Spirit which is upon thee</hi> (to wit the Church) <hi>and my Words which I have put in thy Mouth ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.</hi> And to the Epheſ. 4. cap. v. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That we hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be no more Children toſt too and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every Wind of Doctrine by the ſlight of Men.</hi> If he avow the Church fail'd not in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths, I wonder how he can allow <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Reforming the Church with ſo much Fire, Sword, and Confuſion, for a matter that did not impede Salvation. If they Reform'd Her in Fundamentals, then She periſh'd, which is againſt the Infallible promiſe of CHRIST. If you ſay, they did not Reform it as it lay pure in the Souls of ſome choſen, tho' unknown to others, but in the publick Paſtors and Teachers, who, were reprehenſible for their grievous Deviations, then, ſay I, where was the viſible Church to which Men ſhould have recourſe for the hearing of the Word,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:175808:28"/>and receiving of the Sacraments? <hi>Iſaiah cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Proof and Reaſon is drawn from that it ſeems morally impoſſible, that in the begining of the fourth Age (if he will have the fall of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then) the Paſtors ſhould propoſe a number of new Tenets to be believ'd, and perſwade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they had heard them from their Fathers of the third Age, not one individual Perſon in the mean time remembring that he heard them from his. Is it credible that not only one Pariſh or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but all Countries, who liv'd afore in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, ſhould of a ſudden have permitted themſelves to be cheated into this perſwaſion, or rather bewitch'd, ſince not one was found for many Ages to have gainſaid it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt it? Since this then is Morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, conclude that theſe Tenets of <hi>R. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> which our adverſary calls novelties, were the old tenets of the three firſt Centuries.</p>
                     <p>A third reaſon, 'tis remark'd that God never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any notable Error to riſe up in his Church, but alwayes ſtirred up at the ſame time ſome man or men to ſpeak and write againſt it, and mov'd the whole Church to joyn with them to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Athanaſius</hi> roſe up againſt <hi>Arius. Cyrillus, Alexandrinus,</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius; Auguſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Pelagius.</hi> All back'd by the whole Church for the total overthrowing of thoſe Errors.</p>
                     <p>Now if the <hi>Maſs</hi> be an Error, it is a moſt damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one, an Idolatry inſupportable to give Divine Worſhip to the Hoſt, if it be only a piece of Bread. Yet after this Error was broach'd in <hi>Gregory the Great</hi>'s time, in the ſixth or ſeventh Age as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> imagin, what Univerſity or private Man ſpoke
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:175808:28"/>againſt it then, or three hundred Years after? Its true about four hundred Years after, <hi>Berengarius</hi> inveighed againſt it, but being better inform'd, and by a torrent of Arguments for its Truth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd, he Recanted and Dyed Penitent.</p>
                     <p>Conſult then Reaſon, and not Paſſion, and you will ſee that <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> have made no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructurs on the Faith of the firſt three Ages.</p>

                  <p>I Advance to his aſſertion in which he affirms, that we cannot ſay without Ignorance, Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Injuſtice, that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick. Firſt, I agree with him that an Heretick is he who denyes (<hi>viz.</hi> pertinaciouſly) an Article of Faith, or a revealed Verity.</p>
                  <p>Next, I ask him by what principle he proves, that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> does not deny an Article of Faith or a reveal'd Truth? I ſuppoſe he will Anſwer, becauſe a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> believes the CREED and the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I ask him further, if a Preacher now of their Congregation, ſhould vent a Doctrine not Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and ſhould pertinaciouſly maintain it againſt his Brethren as a Truth, according to his beſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reveal'd in Scripture. By what principle will he convince him to be an Heretick? He'l tell you, he believes the three Creeds, and the whole Scripture, and therefore he believes this his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:175808:29"/>dogme, becauſe the thinks he finds it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Is he an Heretick, becauſe he will not ſubmit his Judgement to his particular Brethren?</p>
                  <p>He is known to be as Learn'd as they, and of as good a Life as they. If you ſay this Man can't be proven to be an Heretick, that is againſt the Scripture, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. bidding us to ſhun an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and conſequently he may be proven to be one. If you ſay he is an Heretick, becauſe he will not ſubmit his Judgement not only to particulars, but neither to the whole Congregation, or the Church, of which he was a Member, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is juſtly condemn'd by Her, according to <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Every Tongue that riſes up againſt thee in Iudgment thou ſhall condemn, this is the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lords Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude, without Ignorance, Calumny, or Injuſtice, that the <hi>Proteſtant Luther,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. were Hereticks, becauſe they would not ſubmit their Judgment to the whole Church of which they were Members afore they were Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for their ſelf Opinions.</p>

                  <p>If you ſay, ſhe is Infallible, and cannot become Heretick, I ask, how came the <hi>Romau</hi> Church, which was once as true a Church as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:175808:29"/>Church is now, (ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies <hi>Romans</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>their Faith was anounc'd</hi> (or Preach'd) <hi>through the whole World,</hi>) to be fallible and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick?</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, this propoſition, a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is not an Heretick, is an Act of Science, then it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon an evidence: No other but that of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo it returns to an Act of Faith.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay 'tis an Act of Opinion only (for one of theſe three either an Act of Faith, of Science, or Opinion it muſt be) then the contrary is alſo probable, then its probable that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is an Heretick, and conſequently it may be ſaid without Ignorance, Calumny, or Injuſtice, a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is an Heretick, or denyes a reveal'd Truth.</p>

                  <p>OUr Adverſary conſcious to himſelf, that we put the Definitions of approv'd General Councils, in the number of reveal'd Truths,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:175808:30"/>Grants indeed that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to be Infallible in their Deciſions, but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, <hi>ſaies he,</hi> is no Article of Faith.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> does not ſay often <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but mended,</hi> there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Words, the one ſuppoſes an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the other only whatſomever defect it being deriv'd from <hi>menda,</hi> which as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his notes upon <hi>varro</hi> remarks, comes from the Latin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <hi>minus,</hi> and properly ſignifies any defect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever. A Maſter Painter draws a Lady, his piece is prais'd as well done, having all its juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, and perfectly all her Features. Another Maſter draws her again with a little more Life, he is alſo ſaid to have drawn her well, nay to have mended the other, So, <hi>well,</hi> ſuffers a Latitude without the Compaſs of Error.

                  <p>If you ask me in what this amendment of a General Council was, or may be made. <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> if you will have this amendment to be the correction of an Error of a General approv'd Council, it is to be underſtood in ſome matters of Fact, or ſome precepts of maners which depending of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Time, Place and Perſons, may have been right and good at one time and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175808:30"/>at another, and therefore chang'd by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the change of circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>And that this was the meaning of St. <hi>Aug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I prove by his following Words, <hi>pleanary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils may be amended, the former by the latter, when,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>by ſome experiment of things that is</hi> Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which was ſhut up <hi>and that known which lay hid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ask can we know by any experiment of things how many perſons are in the Divine Nature? How many in CHRIST, how many Sacraments? No; but the Truth of a Fact, which lay hid, with time may come to Light, and ſo alter the mind of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay the matter in Queſtion here with St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was a matter of Faith. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The matter which gave the occaſion to <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> to ſpeak of General Councils, I grant. the matter at which he hinted in theſe laſt Words, <hi>plenaria Saepe priora poſterioribus emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari,</hi> I deny; and with ground: Becauſe when he ſpeaks of the Letters of Biſhops and of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or National Councils, he uſes theſe Words, <hi>Licere reprehendi, Siquid in eis forte a veritate deviatum eſt,</hi> which import a capacity of down right Error as I ſaid afore: And ſpeaking of General Councils, he cautiouſly uſes the Word <hi>Emendari,</hi> which imports only ſome defect whatſomever.</p>
                  <p>All this is ſtrongly confirm'd by his ſaying in the ſame Chap: that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would certainly have corrected his Opinion, had the point in his time been defin'd by a General Council. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by what he ſayes, <hi>Lib. primo de Bap. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra donat. Tom.</hi> 7. that no doubt ought to be made of what is by full Decree eſtabliſhed in a General
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:175808:31"/>Council, how can this be true, if in his Opinion a General Council may Err? I ask again had there been more then the firſt four General Councils, the fourth being that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> held under <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, the year of our Lord four hundred and fifty, (which four General Councils St. <hi>Gregory</hi> reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the four Evangils) when St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid this, and yet he ſayes <hi>Saepe Emendari,</hi> had he ſeen any mended in matter of Faith?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly I give, to take from you all Scruple, that a General Council may be mended as to the want of a more clear Explication by a poſterior, when experience ſhows us that ſome new ariſing Errors demand, a more ample Declaration of ſome point of Doctrine already defin'd. But that New Declaration gives you no more a new point of Doctrine, then I give you a new Roſe when I blow out a bud which is in your hand; you have no more of a Roſe than you had before, but only a fuller ſight of it. No more have you of the truth in ſuch an Explanation then you had before, but onely a clearer ſight of it. In fine if a poſterior Council might correct a former in matter of Faith, 'twould ſerve for nothing, for why am I more ſure of this, than they of the former? This were only to breed confuſion and foment diviſion, while the adherents of one party claſh with the other, ſince neither has Infallibility as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

God ſends us to the Church for inſtruction, and threatens us there with Damnation, or the puniſhment of an <hi>Ethnick,</hi> if we do not harken to Her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently tells us, that ſhe is Infallible, for his Goodneſs woul dnot oblidge me under pain of Damnation to hear a Church which might lead me wrong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who hears you, hears me,</hi> ſaies CHRIST, to his Diſciples going to preach. <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. but who hears CHRIST is infallibly ſure to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, then alſo he is infallibly ſure, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Church.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>that Chriſt made ſome Paſtors,</hi> (as I ſaid above) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Why? That now we be not Children wavering and carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Hence we inferr, that they are Infallible in what they teach us in matter of Faith, for if I thought them fallible, I might ſtill waver, which would make void the aim of CHRIST in giving us thoſe Paſtors and Teachers, that we might not waver, Then 'tis an Article of Faith to believe that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approv'd Council, or the Teaching Church is Infallible. If our Adverſary ſtill deny this; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to quote to me as clear paſſages out of Scripture, to prove the moſt Bleſſed Trinity, as I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:175808:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>have brought for the Infallibility of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or the Teaching Church: And ſince I am confident he cannot; he has as much Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Infallibility of the Church as an Article of Faith, as he has to believe the Myſtery of the moſt B.

The Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Church is bound to hear the Teaching Church, otherways, how are theſe bound to teach them, or feed them with Doctrine, (as CHRIST com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Church, when he ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep, Iohn</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17.) if they are not bound to receive the Food they give them?

And does not thus, Hell prevail againſt them?</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:175808:34"/>
                  <p>And what an Interpretation <hi>(The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,)</hi> is this of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. That the Church of CHRIST will remain, altho' Inviſible, notwithſtanding the Perſecution of Tyrants, as in the primitive Church after the Death of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who ſaies the primitive Church after the Death of CHRIST was Inviſible? Did not the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then know one another, and where to find a Paſtor for inſtruction, or the receiving of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in neceſſity? And did not the chief Paſtors expoſe themſelves, and ſo became Martyrs the firſt thirty three all one after another?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be an Errable Church, Viſible or Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, 'tis as good as no Church to Chriſtians; for what I have ſaid, and ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>
                  <p>If a particular Church, or Pariſh, Paſtor, and People, ſhould be all the Week diſpers'd here and there about their buſineſs, would they be ſaid to be an Inviſible Church, all the Week, and onely Viſible when they meet on Sunday? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they can find one another on Week dayes in a neceſſity?</p>
                  <p>But truly 'tis not enough to make a true Church Viſible or Inviſible, if they have not among them true Doctrine, as might full out in <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Churches fallibility.</p>
                  <p>To ſhow we can't prove the Infallibility of the Church, from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, the Church is <hi>the Pilla rand Ground of Truth.</hi> 1 <hi>Timot.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15. He explains that paſſage, thus. The Church is <hi>the Pillar of Truth,</hi> ſaies he, becauſe the providence of God will not permit all her Children to fall and Err, but will always ſtirr up ſome to oppoſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Idolatry and Error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Either thoſe who will always oppoſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:175808:34"/>Error and Superſtition, will be Members of the R. Church or not? If they be Members of Her, She will always oppoſe Error, (as when my Hand Writes, I am ſaid to Write) and ſince we know our Saviour has foretold, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. and <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 13. That he will always direct Her by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, 'twill be impoſſible for Her by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential Impotency to Err. Likewiſe, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to compoſe a perpetual direction of the Spirit of God with Error.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Oppoſers of Error, are a Church a part, I ask whether that Church, as diſtinct from the <hi>Roman</hi> be Fallible, or Infallible?</p>
                  <p>If Infallible, we have what we demand, <hi>viz.</hi> That the teaching Church of God is Infallible.</p>
                  <p>If Fallible, then the Church in as much as ſhe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Herſelf to Error, may Err; which is abſurd. The Inference is proven thus.

If he thinks this Queſtion Impertinent, and that it would be Impertinent for a Parliament or an Aſſembly of Men (if they were not otherways impowr'd) to Aſſemble and make an Act by which they will have all to ſubmit and acknowledge that they have a Power to oblige the People.</p>
                  <p>I deſire him to Reaſon the ſame way of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity of a General Council, and know that it has not 'its Infallibility, from its ſaying, we are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, but from God, who has been pleas'd to declare it to us by Apoſtolical Tradition, and in the Holy Scriptures alſo, to thoſe who read them with the Light which they have received from the Church of CHRIST.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:175808:35"/>
                  <p>As a Parliament then is fore-impowr'd to make Acts, and acknowledg'd as ſuch, by the People, afore they ſet themſelves to make any, ſo is the General Council acknowledged by all the Faithful, to have a promiſe from God, of not Erring in their Declaration of an Article of Faith, afore they ſet themſelves to declare it; or by their Explication of a Truth, to take away the Cloud that hindred us to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſ.</hi> Secondly, that it is defin'd in all General approv'd Councils (as much as it was neceſſary) by a practical definition, or their excercis'd power iſſu'd out by them in their oblidging Decrees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſubmiſſively receiv'd by the Faithful. If you ſay ſome have refuſed to receive them, my anſwer is, they ceaſ'd from that time to be number'd among the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>Does not a King ſufficiently declare himſelf to be King, when he uſes the Authority of a King in raiſing Armies and disbanding them, calling a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, adjurning, proroging, or diſolving it at his pleaſure?</p>
                  <p>At laſt our Adverſary brings a ſtrong piece, <hi>viz.</hi> that the General Councils are ſo farr from pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Infallible Judges of controverſial debates, that in a ſet form of prayer appointed to be ſaid atter every Council, they pray that God would ſpare their Ignorance and pardon their Errors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I can't light upon this prayer: Shall I come as good ſpeed in ſeeking it as I did with <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhop?</p>
                  <p>He quots, <hi>de ordin. Cele. Con.</hi> I deſire him to write the Title of the Book at length, or rather tell me at the end of what Council this prayer is found. Since it is to be ſaid after every Council, would not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> have it. This Council
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:175808:36"/>which hath ſet down things ſo exactly would it have omitted this.</p>
                  <p>But now theſe Errors are either in matters given out to the People for Articles of Faith; or not. If not, they make nothing againſt us. If theſe Errors be in matters of Faith, I ask are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Errors or vincible, if they are Invincible, they are not Sinful, and ſo need no pardon If they are vincible, it is either by their diligence in uſing more means to diſcover the Truth, or by an extraordinary aſſiſtance of God. For this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aſſiſtance it is not in their power to have it, and depends only of God. For the other, if they find themſelves not to have us'd all neceſſary means, let them uſe thoſe they have omitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they publiſh their Decrees, (for what a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Impudence would it be, to continue in the Error I can avoid, and ask pardon for it?) and ſo having done what lay in them they will not ſtand guilty afore God, nor in a need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>Rather ſay, (if ſome paſſage be found which may ſeem to have that ſence) that in the fore diſcuſſion of queſtions ſome fear themſelves to have been too much wedded (as is Natural to Man) to their own Opinion, &amp; theſe deſire God to ſpare their Ignorance, not having upheld their Opinion out of Malice, and pardon their fault in this, that they were not (it may be) ſo humble and deferent to others as they ſhould have been.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay provincial Councils anatematize thoſe who reject their deciſions as well as General Councils, and ſo no Argument can be taken from thence for the General Council's Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Provincial Councils anathematize, &amp;c. abſolutly, as the General Councils do, I deny:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:175808:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>conditionally, and with ſubmiſſion to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> I grant: And this confirmes the Infallibility of the Church.</p>
                  <p>To ſatisfie us our adverſary is pleaſed to ſay, the Romaniſts demand how ſhall we reſolve our doubts in matters of Faith if the deciſion of General Councils be fallible? He <hi>Anſwers</hi> by ſetting Reaſon to Reaſon, and trying the matter by the Authority of the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Here I ask if that Collation, or comparing of Reaſon with Reaſon, and tryal by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be fallible or infallible? If fallible it ſerves for nothing in a matter of Faith of which we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for ſince I muſt give an aſſent Infallible <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per omnia</hi> (above all) my doubt muſt be taken infallibly away.</p>
                  <p>If it be Infallible, I ask Again is it in clearing doubts in fundamentals or integrals of Religion? Not infundamentals, for there is no doubt in them, they being according to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> clearly ſet down to Men in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>If in Integrals, then, ſay I, ſince a private man uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that means may be infallibly clear'd in his doubts concerning Integrals, then a General Council uſing the ſame means may be infallibly cleared in them, and conſequently infallibly propoſe them to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be believ'd, ſince they are infallibly found to be reveal'd by God in Scripture, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he who will refuſe to believe them will be juſtly look'd upon as an Heretick.</p>

                     <p>OUr Adverſary having prov'd, as he imagin'd the Fallibility of the teaching Church draws theſe concluſions. The Church is fallible, then ſhe impoſes no obligation to believe her Deciſions as Articles of Faith; then who rejects <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> are not Hereticks.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> From that antecedent <hi>the Church is Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> he might as well have drawn theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, then, <hi>There is no Faith, nor true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, if the Church be fallible in her Deciſions, then ſhe is fallible in teaching us that Chriſtianity is the true Religion; then its only probable that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity

                     <p>If you ſay the former Diſcourſe is not Rational becauſe you have another Principle, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Holy Scripture, by which you prove the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>I ask by what Principle prove you that the ſenſe in which you underſtand the Holy Scripture, and in which only it is to you a Principle of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the Infallibility of Chriſtianity, is the Word of God?</p>
                     <p>By no other, but by your private Light or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but this is Fallible, as I ſhall ſhow anon, then if the other Principle of the whole Churches Deciſion be alſo Fallible, the former Diſcourſe was Rational, it following from any Principle you pleaſe to take for your religion, if your principle carry with it fallibility, and conſequently onely probability of that which is inferred from it.</p>
                     <p>Now, I prove that your private Light or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit is fallible. You are not ſure 'tis the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that enlightens you afore you have try'd it by the Scripture, (<hi>try the Spirit,</hi> ſayes St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. You won't try it by the Church, then you muſt try it by Scripture.) Again, you cannot read the Scripture in Order, to try this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit afore you are ſure you are enlighten'd and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God, for, if perchance it be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:175808:38"/>the ill Spirit transfiguring himſelf into an Angel of Light, who guids you he'l make that ſeem to you true which is falſe. If you can't be ſure it is the Spirit of God that inlightens you, you can't be ſure that the ſpirit, which inlightens you, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; then its fallible, and conſequently your private Light or private Spirit is fallible.</p>
                     <p>And if your private Spirit with all the help of the Scripture is fallible, and in your Opinion the Spirit of the Church in a General Council is alſo fallible, I pray, what Infallible Principle have we from which we may deduce or Demonſtrate the Infallibility of the Chriſtian Religion, if we have none, we are ſhaken out of our Faith and have no true Religion.</p>
                     <p>Be pleas'd to take notice then, that you muſt aſſert with us the Infallibility of the teaching Church.

                     <p>Reflect again, how can we but waver in our thoughts, and be ready to be carried away with every Wind of Doctrine, if we believe that the Church which is Teaching us, is fallible, and ſo, it may be, leading us wrong.

                  <p>In the ſecond place, I ask him, if clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould tell him that Black is White, would he believe it, or not? Would he not believe it? Then he would prefer his private Light to clear Scripture, which to do, is Impious. Would he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:175808:39"/>believe it? Then he is found diſpos'd, ſay I, to admit of any Error if it be ſet down in clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He'll ſay to me the caſe is not alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture is the Word of God, and the Decree of a General Council the Word of Men. But by his Favour, we hold that this alſo is the Word of God, tho uttered to us by the Mouth of Men, according to that of the <hi>Acts cap.</hi> 15. and <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>It hath ſeemed Good to the Holy Ghoſt and us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he ſay 'tis impoſſible that God ſhould ſay by the Scripture, that Black is White, I ſay, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as impoſſible he ſhould ſay it by a General Council, giving it out as a Decree of Faith. But abſolutely ſpeaking, can't that Aſſembly of thoſe Men advance ſuch a propoſition?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Abſolutely ſpeaking they can, but then we would not believe it, becauſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition neither belonging to Faith nor good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (which are the whole and adequat Object to which their Infallibility extends it ſelf, as we <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> hold,) it layes no Obligation upon us to believe it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to give ſomething to what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſayes he heard ſay. Since in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Principles, an Accident is really diſtinguiſh'd from a Subſtance; what if God by his Almighty Power ſhould put the Colour of White in the Subject, in which is the Colour of Black, would this imply a Contradiction? And in this caſe would not this propoſition be true, Black is White, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject having the Colour of Black is the Subject which has the Colour of White.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If I ask any Miniſter, after he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Chriſtened a Child, if he did not Intend to do what CHRIST ordain'd to be done in Baptiſm, and what is ordinarily done by his Church. Without doubt he'l tell me, he did. And this is all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the Church requires in the Prieſt Baptize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, the Prieſt or Miniſter may be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Intention by a thought of his other
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:175808:40"/>affairs, ſo, ſay I, may he be diverted by the ſame from that Intention, which you require, to wit, of pronouncing the Words and applying the Water, and ſo you have as much to fear you are not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd as we. But that which hinders us both to fear, is this, that we do not require an Actual Intention or a Reflection of my underſtanding that my will Intends, which Actual Intention is indeed loſt by a Diſtraction, or thought of another thing (and this ſeems to be the miſtake of our Adverſary, by his ſaying the Prieſt's Intention may be eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to his other affairs) but only a Vertual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which ſtands with an Actual thought of another thing, then that I am doing; as when a Man playes on the Virginals and ſpeaks to another of ſomething elſe, both at once. We ſay this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Fingers is not of it ſelf, but proceeds from a motion of the Will, and a direction of the underſtanding, tho' not ſenſible or preceptible, by Reaſon of the weakneſs of theſe two Acts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſtrength of an Actual Intention. This Intention is called Vertual, becauſe it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> were the Vertue or Vicar of the Actual Intention left by it to ſupply its place in order to do that which was firſt Actually Intended with a ſenſible and ſtrong reflection of the underſtanding upon the Intention of the Will. Neither is it deſtroyed by the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thought of another thing; ſo this other thing be not incompatible with the Action to which this Vertual Intention moves and directs.</p>
                  <p>For Example, my ſpeaking of ſome other thing ſuffers at the ſame time my playing on the Organ, which playing is directed by the Vertual, while I have an Actual Intention to ſpeak of another thing.</p>
                  <p>Now, to prove that in Baptizing this Vertual
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:175808:41"/>Intention is ſufficient, (not denying but that the Actual is moſt laudable) I deſire, Men conſider we have no other in all our Moral Actions which have a notable duration and ſucceſſion of parts. Would you have a Man, who is going a Foot ten miles to a Market, talking earneſtly with another of Buying or Selling, all the Way Actually intend and ſucceſſively reflect, beſide all his other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, upon every individual ſtep of his Journey? This were to make his Head fitter for the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal then for the Market, when he comes thither. Yet to every individual ſtep his Foot is mov'd by the Will intending, and the underſtanding direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Actually, then Vertually, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
                  <p>From all this, you ſee the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> is really as ſecure in matter of Baptiſm as the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and has as little Reaſon as he to fear its nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>But if by a Diabolical malice, which is a caſe more Metaphyſical than Moral, the Prieſt or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had not a ſufficient Intention, and the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Baptiſm were wholly unknown to the Perſon Baptized, then ſuffices an efficacious deſire of it, which, without thinking of it, is included in an Act of true ſorrow for our Sins, for having offended God, or an Act of the Love of GOD; which every Chriſtian being bound often to make is ſuppoſed to make, and ſo remains without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon that Head.</p>
                  <p>As I have ſaid in Baptiſm, ſo in the Collation of Prieſt-hood ſuffices a Vertual Intention in the Biſhop, which Morally cannot be wanting without the Malice of a Devil: But if it ſhould ſall out, which is moſt rare, if really 'twas ever heard of: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irſt, it may be Piouſly believ'd, leaſt the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175808:41"/>be often deceiv'd in that Adorable Sacrifice of the Altar, from which they expect ſo much; that either God gives by his Church the power of Prieſt-hood to thoſe who are in all appearance or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, as the Church gives Jurisdiction in favour of the Faithfull to the very Apoſtats of adminiſtring the Sacrament in a danger of Death; or that he will both manifeſt by his providence over his Church; that want of Intention in the Ordainer, that it may be ſupplied by a reordination, and move thoſe in Authority, whom it concerns, to command it to be done.</p>
                  <p>So that if ſuch a thing be divulged and come to the hearing of high ſuperiors, and they take no notice of it after the caſe is ſufficiently propoſed to them, tis a ſign the rumor is groundleſs.</p>
                  <p>And by this is partly anſwer'd what our adverſary affirmes of a Biſhop in <hi>France,</hi> who, as he ſaies, before his death confeſſed that he had ordained many, but alwayes without a due Intention.</p>
                  <p>Add, if it be true, that ſince the Church did not command ſuch Prieſts ordain'd by him, to be re-ordain'd nor ſuſpended them till then from the function, its to be thought that Biſhop was look'd upon as a Perſon troubled with ſcruples at that time, and in the fear of Death to make his Conſcience ſure not diſtinguiſhing ſufficiently actual Intention from virtual, accus'd himſelf not to have had a due Intention becauſe he thought he had not an actual, or ſomething of that nature not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardable.</p>
                  <p>Another ſtory our Adverſary relates of a Perſon in pain for his Baptiſm being in danger of Death at Sea, of which, he ſaies, he was an Eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I only deſire him to call to mind, and, ſee if he was not rather an Ear witneſs of what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:175808:42"/>he heard related by another, than of what he ſaw himſelf (for which I have ſome Ground) and if it be ſo let him remember that the perſons pain was not about the Intention of the Miniſter but abſolutely whither or not he had been Baptiz'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering of the conjuncture of circumſtances in which he was born, <hi>viz.</hi> a Baſtard of a Catholick Father among the Presbyterians, who would not Baptize a Baſtard unleſs the Father gave obedience to the Church or Synod.</p>
                  <p>However, I ask our Adverſary, if he was an Eye witneſs, whither the doubt ſeem'd to him ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or not? If it ſeemed rational he being a fit Miniſter of the Sacrament he ſhould have Baptiz'd him under condition; if not, he ſhould have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, making him remember what we teach, to wit, that in caſe our Baptiſm had not been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, an efficacious deſire of Baptiſm included in an Act of true ſorrow for our Sins, or pure love of God, ſuffices.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall make appear now that we have in this caſe of Baptiſm ſecurity for our Salvation, and they have none, we ſtanding to our Tenets, and they to theirs.</p>
                  <p>Take me a Proteſtants Child validly Baptiz'd by a Miniſter (as we grant they can) let the Child dye afore the uſe of reaſon, what becomes of him according to the Catholick Tenet, we hold it goes ſtraight to Heaven. What becomes of him according to the Proteſtant Tenet? They ſay it may be he's ſav'd, <hi>viz.</hi> if he was one of the Elect and conſequently the Parents were of the Faithful; and it may be he's damn'd, if the Parents were not of the Faithful, <hi>to wit,</hi> Spiritual
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:175808:43"/>Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> or the Child, tho' of Faithful Parents, was not of the Elect; for I hope they will not ſay that Faithful Parents have never a Wicked or a Reprobat Child.</p>
                  <p>And how ſhall I know Faithful Parents but by their Fruits or Works, and how ſhall I know that their Works are good? Since many wicked People have had ſeeming good Works. Nay how ſhall I know a man to have Faith by Works that are all damnable and worthy of Death, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 4.

                  <p>Next, ſuppoſe that the Parents be of the Faithful, who told you the Child is one of the Elect? To us his Baptiſm is a ſure mark of his Election. You have no ſuch, ſee you then how in this caſe we have ſecurity and you have none? The other Motive he brings to a Proteſtant, is that Proteſtants are ſav'd more eaſily.

                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Milk, not then ſtronger Food ſaying to them that they were not yet able, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Wiſe Parents at a great Table do not let their Children take what they pleaſe but give them of Meats preſented what they know to be fit for their weak Stomach. So the Church allows the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feed themſelves with the Holy Scripture, ſhe gives of the ſame Table to the unlearned by their Paſtors and Teachers what is fitteſt for them, leſt having the whole Bible in their hands (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially without the Notes for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) they wrong themſelves, as thoſe who as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. ſpeaks, wreſted ſome paſſages of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as alſo the other Scriptures to their own deſtruction. Deſtruction Implyes more then miſtakes in Indifferent matters.</p>
                  <p>Would it not ſtartle an Ignorant to hear (afore the Paſſage is explained) what God ſaid to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Blind the heart of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. Leſt perhaps they may ſee with their Eyes and be converted.</hi> Would an Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſays an Ignorant, command a Prophet to do ſo? Would it not amaze the ſame to read in the firſt of <hi>Hoſea v.</hi> 1. <hi>That God commanded him to take a Whore and take to himſelf Children of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Is it poſſible, ſayes the Ignorant, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:175808:45"/>Sanctity it ſelf ſhould ſpeak ſo?</p>
                  <p>With what ſurprizing paſſages will an Ignorant Carnal Man meet with in the <hi>Canticles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reſpect then the Holy Ghoſt in the Conduct of the Church, and do not think that her Children, who do not, nor cannot read the Scriptures live in ignorance, Lukewarmneſs, Indifferency with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reliſhing Heavenly things, without true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, more then <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who had the ſame want, but were Inſtructed to the Piety we read of, by the Tradition from others, as our unlearn'd are by the Labours of our Paſtors and Preachers who not being diverted from their Book and Prayer, by the neceſſary care of providing for Wife and Children, Meditate at leaſure the Holy Bible, and ſtudy how they may beſt deliver to the People the Truths they find there both neceſſary to Salvation, and conducing to Perſection. And this aboundantly ſuffices, unleſs you will exclude alſo among Proteſtants all thoſe, who cannot read, from Devotion, as if God had deſign'd only great Wits for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, that if the Scripture put into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Mans hand and being underſtood by him according to his beſt Judgement, be to him a ſufficient Rule of Faith (which without doubt would breed as much confuſion in the Church as the Law Book Interpreted by every private Man without Obligation to ſubmit to the Kings Judges, would do in the Kingdom) what need have you of Miniſters more then Quakers? If every one be thus capable to underſtand the Word, why is he not capable to Preach it? And if he be capable to Preach it to others, or ſtirr them up to the Faith of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, why is he not capable to give alſo the Sacrament, or the Sign of it receiv'd.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:175808:46"/>
                  <p>If you ſay that God has ordained Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to Govern the Church; I anſwer, 'tis not Civily, but in Doctrine, &amp; what will this Government in our caſe ſerve for but to make them Hypocrites, ſince they muſt then believe outwardly what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Teaches, and inwardly what their own light perſwades them, often contrary to the Miniſters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>When we ſay the Bible doth not contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, we do not ſay that the Word of God does not contain all things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the Word of God is partly written partly unwritten; Put theſe two together and you have all things neceſſary to Salvation. Nay the Scripture alone has partly Explicitly partly Implicitly, in as much as it ſends us to the Church, all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>When we ſay that the Scripture is not abſolutely, But in ſome places obſcure, in others clear; what do we ſay more then <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who teach that the Scripture is an Interpreter of it ſelf, if you compare the leſs clear paſſage with another or others more clear; is not this to ſay that the leſs clear is obſcure? which obſcurity is taken away by the clearneſs of the other.</p>
                  <p>Neither do we ſay that the Scripture is Imperfect when we ſay it is only a part of our Rule of Faith, no more then we ſay the Almighty Power of God is Imperfect when we ſay 'tis only a part of his Infinite Perfection. As we do not ſay that God is Finit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a part of this Couple contained in <hi>Chriſt-God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> or by which we ſay <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> are two, <hi>viz.</hi> natures.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. <hi>The Scripture is not known to us to be the Word of God without the Tradition of the Church, and therefore is not our ſole Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE acknowledge the Holy Scriptures to be our Rule of Faith, but not alone; we believe them to be profitable to teach us in Juſtice, that the Man of God may be perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. But not ſole ſufficient to make him perfect.</p>
                  <p>We ſeem, ſayes our Adverſary, to doubt of the Originals of Scripture, ſince we ask a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> how he knows it is the Word of God? As if the Air, Simplicity, Majeſty, and way of Expreſſion proper to God alone, did not ſhow this ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the King's Letters are known by their ſtyle and Royal Seal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We are ſo far from doubting of the Scriptures being the Word of God, that we believe it with an Act of Divine Faith. But we have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ask without any Anſwer, that has ſo much as a jot of Reaſon, by what Principle they will prove to us that the Scripture is the Word of God. If beſides the Scripture there is no Rule of Faith?</p>
                  <p>Not by the Scripture it ſelf, becauſe ſelf Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:175808:47"/>is none, were it Written in any place of it, that this Bible containing ſo many, and ſuch Books is the Word of GOD, for the Queſtion returns, how know you that this Teſtimony is the Word of GOD?</p>
                  <p>Now, to ſay that ſhe Scripture ſhows it ſelf, is frivolous. For I ask what's that to ſay the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhows it ſelf? Is it that by Reading it, riſes in the mind of a Man who has a well diſpoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, this apprehenſion, <hi>The Scripture is the Word of God?</hi> By which apprehenſion he ſees it is ſo, before he Judges or believes? If ſo, then he does not believe the Word of God to be the Word of God, mov'd by the Word of God, but by this apprehenſion, which if you ſay is the Word of God, then you admit a Word of God which is not Written, and yet to you a Rule of Faith, and ſo you have another Immediate Rule of Faith, than the Written Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, that apprehenſion and inward Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the mind for which its believed that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Word of GOD, and that it ſhows it ſelf, does it riſe from this, that the Simplicity, Majeſty, and way of Expreſſion, move Men to Judge that the Scripture is the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing all theſe particulars come from ſuch Words Inſtituted by Men to ſignifie, and that the more or leſs Majeſty of the Style, in a Speech or Sentence riſes from a certain material placing and diſpoſing of Words among themſelves, the whole thing is natural, and ſo not the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Next, that Simplicity and Majeſty of Style, and what you pleaſe more, is not ſo in every part of Scripture, that I am bound for them to believe, that that part is the Word of God. For I pray, what Air, Simplicity, or Majeſty of Style is in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:175808:47"/>begining of the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> when its ſaid there, <hi>Abraham begot Iſaac and Iſaac begot Iacob;</hi> what do you find more there then you would find in thoſe ſame Words written in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, not Sacred, as in <hi>Ioſeph the Iew?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if you ask us why we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the Word of God? We Anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Infallible Tradition paſſing through all Ages, and always believing it to be the Word of God, has conveyed it to our Hands, and that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approv'd Councils have confirm'd it by their Sacred Decrees and uncontrolable Authority, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as any Controverſie aroſe among the Faithful, either concerning certain Books, or the certainty of the Tradition it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay you make uſe of this ſame Tradition of all Chriſtians hitherto believing it to be the Word of God, as a motive of Credibility to you that it is the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> You may, but firſt by claiming to this, you leave your own Principle of denying Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Next, tho' this Univerſal Tradition be to you a motif of Credibility, that the Bible is the Word of God as to the Letter, yet you have none for the ſenſe, in which you take it.</p>

                  <p>OUr Adveriary advancing in his Reflexions upon our Religion ſayes that our Prayers in an Unknown Tongue is not a ſmall hinderance to Piety and Devotion. What Comfort, ſayes he, can the Ignorant ſort reap at Maſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Either he means our Private Prayers or our Publick: If our Private Prayers, I atteſt his own Conſcience, all <hi>Engliſh and Scots</hi> Proteſtants, who converſe Familiarly with us if they do not know that we have our <hi>Manuals of Devotion in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he means our Publick Prayers: Then he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes two things which are falſe. The firſt that, that publick Action which is done in the Sacrifice of the Maſs, is, or ought ſimply to be called a verbal Prayer; The ſecond that, that leſs conſiderable part of it which conſiſts in Words, is in an unknown Tongue.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrifice of the Maſs being of its Nature, and by the Intention of Chriſt the Inſtituter of it, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:175808:49"/>chief Officer in it, an Action ordain'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Fathers Supream Dominion over us; to give him thanks for his Favours beſtowed upon us, for a continuation of them, and a Satisfaction for our Sins, it is a prayer, but a real one and is more the object of the Eye then of the Ear: Moreover is it not enough that the Maſs is Printed in Vulgar Tongues? And that the Council of <hi>Trent. Seſſ.</hi> 22. <hi>cap</hi> 8. Commands the Paſtors to explain it to the People altho it be not ſaid but in the Tongues of the Church: In the Greek Church in Greek, in the Latin in Latin, to keep an uniformity among the Faithful of each Church and that the expreſſion of the Churches Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy keep its Majeſtie not ſubject to the changes of Vulgar Tongues, to which thoſe are, who ſpeak them, under pain of paſſing ſometimes for Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>Neither is that to be call'd an Unknown Tongue which little Boyes are ordinarily taught in the Schools, and which they come often to ſpeak Regularly before they can expreſs themſelves handſomly in their Mothers Tongue. Neither do our Country Clowns ſpeak unknown Tongues becauſe they don't eaſily underſtand one another.</p>
                  <p>But Grant the Latin Tongue is an unknown Tongue, is it not enough that all thoſe prayers are found explained in Books?</p>
                  <p>Neither does the Devotion of the Ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their hearing or knowing what the Prieſt ſays but in knowing what he does. And in offering up with him the ſame Sacrifice which is alſo theirs, ſure, if they be well diſpoſed, to receive great good by it. I pray, did the People in the entry of the Temple hear what <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſaid when he was Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating far from being ſo much as ſeen by them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 10. <hi>and the People wondred that he ſtayed there ſo long.</hi> v. 21.</p>

Is that a known or an unknown Tongue when the Hearers can't make ſence of his words, but only knows his meaning is to pray? To this he adds a bare Lecture of Scriptures ſometimes of a Prophet obſcure in his Expreſſion, they know not whither its to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Literal or Figurative ſenſe, yet what a ſighing and ſobing! What a mournful Looks in their Eyes! And murgions in their Faces! If this Prayer and lecture of Scripture neither of them being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, can move theſe People to ſo much Devotion becauſe they know this is ſaid and read to Honour God; why may not the Sacrifice of the Maſs which <hi>Catholicks</hi> believe to be the higheſt Honour that can be given to God upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>I end this Section with ſome Reflections,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. does not ſpeak of a publick Prayer approved by the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not ſubject to Error, But only of a new Prayer of a private Perſon made to others which might be ſubject to Error, and therefore he would not have it made in a Vulgar Tongue, but in a Tongue that others might judge of it, as appears by his ſaying in the 29, <hi>v. Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues,</hi> i. e. <hi>in an unknown tongue,</hi> I ſay then what Chriſtian dares forbid what the Apoſtle allows?</p>

                  <p n="4">4. As, altho' an Inchanter underſtands not the words of his Charm the Devil underſtands them, and obeys them, ſo, altho the Ignorant underſtand not the words of his Prayer, the Devil underſtands them and fears them; and God underſtands them, and helps him, as the King does a Favour to an Idiot who underſtood not the Petition preſented by him, but only in General that it was for what he deſired, or made in favour of him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If any be contentious for our not uſing a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue in our Lyturgy, our Anſwer is with St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 16. we have no ſuch Cuſtome nor has had the Church of God for 1600. Years, and more.</p>

                  <p>OUr Adverſary ſayes, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> deſtroyes all evidence grounded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of our ſenſes, and makes void the proof CHRIST made uſe of to his Apoſtles, to convince them he was not a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. To underſtand my Anſwer to this Objection of our Adverſary, you muſt know;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Principle of experimental knowledge is this, for example, whereſoever are all the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Bread, there is the ſubſtance of Bread, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Author of Nature hinder its preſence there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this conditional muſt be alwayes added in Reverence to the Almighty Power of God; otherwayes by this Experimental knowledge, <hi>a Combuſtible thing laid in the Fire burns.</hi> 'Twould follow that the Children in the Furnace of <hi>Babylon</hi> were burnt contrary to what is ſaid in <hi>Daniel</hi> 3, <hi>cap. v.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things being known, I anſwer, that evidence grounded upon experimental Knowledge ſtands in its full vigour with our Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, as is clear to him, who in this true Suppoſition of Experimental Knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:175808:51"/>
                  <p>For we deny Bread to be in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> where all the Accidents of Bread are, becauſe the Author of Nature hinders the preſence of Bread to be there as he has revealed it to us in ſeveral places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And conſequently I deny that Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation deſtroyes more Experimental Knowledge, than <hi>Proteſtant's</hi> belief that the Angels, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Abraham, Lot</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> were Angels and not Men, deſtroys it.</p>
                  <p>Had not the Angels appearing to them all the Accidents of Men, as our <hi>Euchariſt</hi> has all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Bread: And did not they look as like men, as it looks like Bread?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes void, ſayes he, the proof Chriſt brought to his Apoſtles to convince them he was not a Spirit. <hi>Handle me and ſee, ſayes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for a Spirit has no Fleſh, Luke</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 39. which can be no conviction to <hi>Romaniſts</hi> who ſee Bread in the Euchariſt, if they will truſt their own Senſes, <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> make void the proof Chriſt made uſe of to his Apoſtles when they ſay that the Angels (of which afore) that appeared to <hi>Abraham, Lot</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> were not Men but Angels? No, ſay you, becauſe GOD hath revealed that they were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</p>
                  <p>Neither do we <hi>Romaniſts</hi> when we ſay that in the Euchariſt that which appears like Bread is the Body of Chriſt under the form of Bread, and not Bread; becauſe our Saviour hath Revealed that it is his Body.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviours proof, ſays our Adverſary, that he was not a Spirit ſhall never influence a Papiſt to conviction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This I deny, for in this caſe, we have both evidence of the ſenſes and our Saviours Word,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:175808:52"/>and no Revelation contradicting them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are fully convinc'd to believe it. But for Bread in the Euchariſt we have indeed the evidence of ſenſe, but not Chriſts word, but on the contrary we have our ſenſes contradicted by Chriſts infallible word. Muſt not a Man be in Eclipſe, or under a Cloud not to ſee this Diſparity.</p>
                  <p>To clear then our Adverſary in his miſtake, I let him know that our Saviour undertook to prove that he had a true Body, which is the Natural Remote object of our ſenſes, by the Judgment of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſenſes: But never to prove Immediatly an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Myſtery of Faith ſuch as our Euchariſt is, by the Judgment of our ſenſes. I ſay Immediatly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having prov'd Immediatly that this was his true Body, mediatly he proved in that Circumſtance that it was riſen again. Nay when we come to ſuch Myſteries of Faith, we muſt not only Captivate our Senſes but Reaſon alſo, if we will believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>As to that he ſayes that our Tranſubſtantiation favours the Opinion of the <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> its manifeſtly falſe to thoſe who know the <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> Opinion, <hi>to wit,</hi> that Chriſt had not a true Body, but only in appearance. For who grants our Tranſubſtantiation muſt grant that the Body of Chriſt is there either real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſubſtantially or in appearance: But under the appearance of Bread cannot be the appearance of the Body of Chriſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Shape, Bulk, Colour, and Extention of all the parts of his Body, for how can all theſe ſtand together with the proper Accidents of Bread in the leſt Particle of the Hoſt? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they not being there, his reall Body muſt be there to make the grant of Tranſubſtantiation good.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>OUr Adverſary ſaies, let us torture our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive faculty never ſo much, we ſhall never be able to prove that our ſenſes are not deceived repreſenting to us as Bread, what really, if we are believed, is not Bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That our ſenſes are not deceived in their proper Object, I prove thus,</p>
                     <p>The proper Object of our ſenſes (are only the Accidents of Bread; in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> our ſenſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us the Accidents, Colour, Taſte, &amp;c. after the Conſecration juſt as they did afore; then they are not at all deceived in their proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>You'l ſay, their proper Object is alſo the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread, and in that they are deceived, ſince after Conſecration according to us there is no Bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny that the Subſtance of Bread is their proper Object, its the Object of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which from the ſenſes Anticedent repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to him of all the Accidents of Bread, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that the Subſtance of Bread is there, <hi>viz.</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and naturally when it is not revealed to him, that the Author of Nature has diſpoſed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. So that the Subſtance of Bread is only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, by Accident and occaſionally, called the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:175808:53"/>Object of our ſenſes, in as much as they by their Relation to him of all the Accidents of a Subſtance, give him occaſion to Judge certainly that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is alſo there, when he has no Revelation from God of the contrary.</p>
                     <p>If our Eyes are deceived in <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> was not the <hi>Iews</hi> Eyes deceived in the Incarnation, repreſenting CHRIST as a Human Perſon.</p>
                     <p>By this ſolution you have an Anſwer to all his empty, talk of Roſes and Lillies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, I can never acertain you of any thing my Eyes ſees; for if I ſee all the Accidents of a Roſe and have no Revelation from the Author of Nature, that the Subſtance of a Roſe is not there, I can aſure you that it is a Roſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Anſwer ſerves, when he ſaies that as my Eye may be deceived, ſo, may alſo my Ear, which gives a Mortal blow to Tradition, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by hearing. For we have ſaid already, that neither Eye nor Ear are deceiv'd in their Object, becauſe as the Eye ever repreſents the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſo the Ear conveys ever to the underſtanding the ſame ſound, and as the Subſtance which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Colour is the Object of the underſtanding and not of the Eye; ſo likewaies the Truth or Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Word is the Object of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not of the Ear.</p>
                     <p>You'l ſay if Accidents only are the Object of our ſenſes, how do you underſtand theſe propoſitions, I ſee Bread, I Taſte Wine? Which are common Expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We ſpeak ſo, becauſe the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which fals upon the Inſtrument, often is given to the thing of which it is an Inſtrument, and ſo, as, when my Hand is hurt, I am ſaid to be hurt, becauſe my Hand is an Inſtrument of my Body,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:175808:53"/>by which it Acts, ſo when the ſavour of the Wine is taſted, the Wine is ſaid to be taſted, becauſe it is an Inſtrument or Vertue that flowes from the Wine, and by which the Wine affects your Taſte.</p>
                     <p>Out of all I have ſaid gather this Truth, that neither Senſe nor Reaſon is deceiv'd in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt;</hi> not our ſenſes becauſe they find all the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſame condition after Conſecration, in which they were before. Not Reaſon, becauſe Reaſon tells me, that I ought to believe that the Subſtance of Bread is there where all its Accidents are, unleſs God reveal to me the contrary, and in that caſe not to believe it to be there. But God has reveal'd it not to be there, ſo when I now believe it not to be there my Reaſon is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
                     <p>Now to oppoſe this revelation or Infallible word of Chriſt, we claim to, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> he ſaies <hi>Litera occidit,</hi> the letter kills.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The letter kills indeed when it taken in the literal ſenſe involves a contradiction, or any thing againſt Faith, or good manners; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes not. So this propoſition <hi>Chriſt is a Vine,</hi> taken literally kills, becauſe the verb <hi>is</hi> in it taken literally Imports an Identification or ſamety of two natures, ſpecifically different contrary to that we know by Faith, to wit, that the Son of God hath aſſum'd no nature but that of man: And in this propoſition <hi>This is my Body</hi> taken literally, the verb <hi>is,</hi> imports onely an Indentification of the ſame thing with it ſelf, onely otherwayes expreſt, leſs deſtinctly in the ſubject. <hi>This,</hi> and more deſtinctly in the predicate my <hi>Body.</hi>

                     <head>Subſect. II. <hi>Shows that Tranſubſtantiation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclines us to Idolatry nor Hypocriſie, with ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>OUr Adverſary's ſecond way of oppoſing Tranſubſtantiation is to ſay, that it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines mean Capacities to Idolatrie and the ſharper wits to Hypocriſie. The Common People no doubt, ſaies he, do frequently adore the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (according to his conceſſion <hi>pag.</hi> 90. They are taught as he ſaies there to adore Chriſt under the Accidents) they ſee which they call God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Wafer is lifted by the Prieſt, <hi>on leve Dieu,</hi> God is lifted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation expreſly commands to adore what they do not ſee, <hi>quod, non vides,</hi> and forbids to Adore what is ſeen. If, nevertheleſs ſome do the contrary, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not therefore blameable, no more then the Law is to be blam'd, becauſe ſome do quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its Rule and Inſtruction. For that ſaying <hi>on leve Dieu,</hi> God is lifted if it can be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blaſphemy that God was lifted upon the Croſs, becauſe Chriſt's Body was lifted upon the Croſs, it may likewiſe be ſaid without Blaſphemy that God
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:175808:54"/>is lifted up in the Sacrifice of the Maſs, becauſe Chriſts Body is there lifted up. By a Communication of properties, what is atributed to Chriſt's Body, is atributed to Chriſt, and what is atributed to Chriſt, is atributed to God.</p>
                     <p>For the ſharp wits they ſee that according to the probable Opinion of Proteſtants, Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt is not there as in a place, becauſe to be in a place is to be with the full extention of its parts correſponding to the parts of the place, but this Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt has not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not there in a place: And therefore, tho' it be there and in Heaven both at once, it is not in two places both at once; yet largely and improperly ſpeaking, the Body of Chriſt may be ſaid to be in the Euchariſt, as in a place in as much as it is united to the Accidents which are in a place. The Body then of Chriſt is there after the exiſting way of a Spirit. If you ſay the Body of Chriſt can't be united to Accidents in different places, I ask how is our Soul united to different parts of the Body, which are in different places?</p>
                     <p>Juſt then as the Soul is not in a place, yet is ſaid to be above and below, before and behind, becauſe the parts to which it is united are above and below, before and behind; ſo when the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to which Chriſt's Body is united in the Euchariſt are mov'd or lifted up, it is ſaid to be mov'd or lifted up. So its a ſilly thing for Proteſtants to object to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks the obſurdities which ſeem to follow from a Body's being in two places, ſince they may ſay that the Body of Chriſt by its being in the Euchariſt is not in two places. Thus you ſee our witty People have not occaſion to be Hypocrites but ſincere believers.</p>
                     <p>If our Adverſary ſaies a Body can be no more without Extention, then Water without humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:175808:55"/>Fire without Heat, a Stone without Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I grant it is ſo naturally, but he muſt mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant to me, that it may be as well without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſupernaturally, as a Fire without burning, having within the ſplear of its activity, a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible which was ſeen in the Furnice of <hi>Babylon Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> And a Stone, by the ſtroke of a Rod to yield a Fountain of Water, <hi>Exod:</hi> 17. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 6. is as ſurpriſing as Water it ſelf without Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity.</p>
                     <p>Let <hi>Catholicks</hi> then mark well this, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> does not at all force them to avow, that CHRIST's Body is in two parts extenſiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or with the extenſion of its parts.</p>
                     <p>Our Adverſary objects, that all Miracles muſt be viſible, but in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the Subſtance into which the Bread is changed is not viſible, then there is no ſuch Miraculous change in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the Major propoſition, for to whom was viſible the Conception and Birth of CHRIST of a <hi>Virgin-Mother?</hi> To whom was viſible the Creation of the World? What Man ſaw the Nothing out of which all was made, and upon that account was moved to ſay, the Being of the World was a Miracle?</p>
                     <p>Let him know then that God has made two ſorts of Miracles, the one of neceſſity Viſible, becauſe they are motives to us of Credibility, or to move us to believe. Such were the Miracles by which CHRIST proved his Divinity; <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was ſent by God; ſuch were and are the Miracles by which the <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Church proves that ſhe is the true Church of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Other Miracles God has made, which are meer Objects of Faith, and matters to us of ſubmiting
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:175808:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>our underſtandings to his Word, as our will to his Command. Theſe matters on one ſide muſt not be Viſible, for what ſubmiſſion is there of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to aſſent to what I ſee; on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, they muſt be ſtrange and above Nature, to give worthily to my Faith the Name of a Soveraign and pure Submiſſion, ſuch as is due to the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God. Of this Nature are the Myſteries of the Incarnation in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ends his Battery againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantion</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with this Argument, theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. are not a true and real Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; (for he ſayes not, <hi>I leave you my Body,</hi> which is the uſual manner of uttering our ſelves in Teſtaments) therefore they may be taken in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, <hi>CHRIST</hi> calls his laſt Supper the New Teſtament, ſhall I believe him, or our Adverſary? <hi>(This Cup the New Teſtament in my Blood, which ſhall be poured out for you and for many:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Is not the Teſtament of any other, then 'tis Chriſt's Legacy to his Apoſtles and others of the Faithful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> No Teſtator ever made his Teſtament more clearly and expreſly. Other Teſtators ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily make their Teſtament only by Words; <hi>CHRIST</hi> by Words and deed. By deed, in as much as being to depart, he gave them with his own hands: By Word, ſaying, <hi>Take eat this is my Body:</hi> When they took, did not he give? And to give to them, and give it to be given to others, is not that the ſame as to leave? When a Souldier dying in the Camp, gives his Sword to his Companion, is not that as much as to ſay, I leave it you? St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſayes in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:175808:56"/>the New lyes hidden; and in the New the Old lyes open. Was not then the Old Teſtament a true Teſtament and a Figure of the New, (<hi>the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1.) and is the Figure more a true Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the Teſtament figured?</p>
                     <p>After I have anſwered the difficulties our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary finds in <hi>Tranſubſtantion,</hi> I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask him ſome Queſtions about their Tenet in the ſame matter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if the Symbols of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be but Bread and Wine, and at the moſt, have nothing more than the Miniſters Bleſſing above Common Bread and Wine, is it not as much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, to give them that reſpect they receive from <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as it is in us to reſpect <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s and Holy-Water?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They can't increaſe or improve in the Juſtice they are ſuppoſed to have applyed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before, by believing that all their Sins are forgiven by the Merits of Chriſt, what is then the effect of their Communion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Since according to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Body of <hi>CHRIST</hi> cannot be Eaten but by Faith, and again, ſince this Faith muſt be not a Faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, nor an Hiſtorical Faith, but a ſaving Faith, or a <hi>fiducia,</hi> a confidence that their Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them by the Merits of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>I infer, then they cannot Eat the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unworthily, for by Eating <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s Body with a ſaving Faith I ſave my ſelf, by Eating it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily I damn my ſelf; but I can't ſave and damn my ſelf both at once, then I can't Eat the Body of CHRIST unworthily. But this contradicts St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay with Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> true
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:175808:56"/>Body is there, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Sacrament really, but yet that the reallity and verity of his Body cannot be there, ſince <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> does not come from Heaven to the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Is not this to ſhut up a <hi>Chymera</hi> between theſe two Words, <hi>He's there,</hi> as a nothing between two Diſhes.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore then are they ſaid by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 20, to have <hi>Sacrificed to Devils and not to God. All the Gods of the Gentils are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> ſayes <hi>David</hi> Pſalm 95. then thoſe to whom they directed their Worſhip was not God, then they and <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not agree in their Religious Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes again, that relative Worſhip was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh'd in the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> For he can't imagine they adored the Calf as a true God, unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as void of Reaſon as the Calf it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They believed the Calf to be a God, able to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Theſe are thy Gods</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who have brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. And (1 of the Kings according to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>) cap. 12. v. 28. Jeroboam <hi>made two Golden Calves and ſaid to them, go up no more to</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>behold thy Gods</hi> Iſrael. Tho our Adverſary can't imagin this. Who could have imagin'd that thoſe great Philoſophers of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Romans v.</hi> 23. to whom God had given great Lights, by which they came to the knowledge of him, ſhould <hi>have chang'd the Glory of an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God into the Adoration of Men, Birds, four-footed Beaſts and Serpents?</hi> (Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak plain here?) I grant then they were as void of Reaſon in that, as the Calf they Ador'd. What is a Man left by God?</p>
                  <p>But what was the Reaſon of this their fall from Reaſon? Hear it from the ſame Apoſtle <hi>v.</hi> 21. having known God, they did not Glorifie him as God, nor thanked him for ſo great a benefit, but proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh'd in their thoughts, for which ill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior and ingratitude, how did he puniſh them? By a with-drawing of his Light; <hi>obſcuratumeſt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:175808:57"/>cor cor eorum,</hi> and as a Man in the dark runs his Head againſt a Wall, they wanting the Light of Grace; run themſelves into the ſhameful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of corrupted Nature, exchanged Truth with Lyes, and gave the Honour they owed to God, to a Creature.</p>
                  <p>Mindfull of this, wonder no more that a Man who leaves God, may become as void of Reaſon as a Calf. To return then to our Fooliſh <hi>Iſraelits</hi> was that way of ſpeaking, <hi>theſe are thy Gods,</hi> in the plural number, a repreſentation of one God in one Eſſence and Nature?</p>
                  <p>From the Golden Calf let us come to our Images, they are called the Books of Ignorants, but in our Adverſaries Judgement, ought rather to be term'd the Books of Ignorance, becauſe they are the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of many Errors, ſayes he. For Example, the Picture of an Old Man, repreſenting God the Father, a Dove, the Holy Ghoſt, are apt to make the Ignorant ſort believe they have indeed ſome ſuch ſhape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> VVe muſt then blot out of the Holy Scripture all theſe expreſſions and ways of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which God is ſaid to Heare, to See, to repent <hi>Gen: c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Leſt the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People think that God has Ears and Eyes and ſorrow in his Hart as we have. Now reflect that theſe Pictures are not repreſentatives of God the Father or of the Holy Ghoſt immediatly, but of an old Man and a Dove which are the Symbols of God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt in as much as they in ſome ſort repreſent to us the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive perfections of thoſe Divine Perſons! As the old Man is the Principle of his ſon, and not mutualy principal'd by him; ſo God the Father is the principle of God the Son and God the Holy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:175808:58"/>Ghoſt and is not principal'd by them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the puritie and fecundity of the Dove makes us more ſenſible of the Sanctity we are ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave particularly from the Holy Ghoſt as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of purity; and of the fecundity of his grace brought forth in us. The occaſion then of Decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if there be any, is not in the Images, but in the things Immediatly repreſented by Them.</p>
                  <p>I hope the Zeal of our <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> will not be ſo blind on this account, as to ſtudy the Extirpation of Doves, and ridding the World of old Men: ſince it is not to be thought that Chriſtians are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be found of ſo groſs an imagination, as to think that the Nature or Eſſence of God, or the Holy Ghoſt can be Painted out to our Eyes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they may be Painted in that Figure it pleaſed them to appear, as God appeared to <hi>Daniel</hi> with the Hairs of his Head as pure Wool, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9. And the Holy Ghoſt in Form of a Dove, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>

                  <p>ALtho' our Adverſary think it undeniable, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Adore more than <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> in Spirit and Truth, becauſe they Adore God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,

Shall I ſay, that Mans Heart Adores God whoſe Hand does not do his duty to him? <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> do not give to God the chief Adoration, which is due to him, as he is above all Creatures, I mean a proper Sacrifice, which was ever eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, and is the great Act of Religion, and how ſhall I believe that their Spirit Adores him?</p>
                  <p>Self-denyals and Mortifications of the Fleſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and practiſed by the Antient Church out of a reſpect to God they retrench, and how ſhall I know that in Spirit they Adore him? He requires as an Homage from Men to keep his Commands, ſaying, <hi>my Yoke is eaſie and my Burden is light,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> tell him flatly; they can't do it. Is this to ſubmit their Judgment to his, and ſo in Spirit Adore him?</p>
                  <p>Neither do they Adore him in Truth. Who knew which way God was to be truly Ador'd, or according to his will before he reveal'd it? Now that he has reveal'd it in the Holy Scriptures, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt us to the Church, for the underſtanding of this way of Adoring in theſe Words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Who will not hear the</hi> Church <hi>let him be to the,</hi> &amp;c. Since <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not hear Her, ſhall I ſay that doing contray to his Command, they Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him truly or in Truth Adore him?

(as he excus'd himſelf to <hi>Samuel</hi>) to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, did he in that truly Adore God? No,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:175808:59"/>but his own will tranſgreſſing the Command of God; ſo <hi>Proteſtants</hi> taking a way of their own, to ſerve God contrary to his Command, in his Holy Word they do not truly ſerve him, nor in Truth Adore him.</p>
                  <p>When our Adverſary condemns our ſerving of God by the help of Images, he condemns himſelf. For he can't Adore God without thinking of him; this thought a good will cheriſhes, drives away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which hinder or weaken it, ſtrives to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and beggs of God to continue it, and ſo ſhows by all this a great reſpect for it: And why ſo much reſpect for it? Becauſe it helps the will to move more frequently and attentively to GOD. And at laſt this good thought is found to be an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, for it is an Act of the underſtanding, and every Act of the underſtanding is a repreſentation of its Object, and this repreſentation is an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The Holy Synod,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>commands the Pictures of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>of the Virgin Mother of</hi> GOD, <hi>and other Saints, to be had and retained, eſpecially in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that one give to them the due reſpect and Veneration; not that we believe that there is any Divinity or Vertue in them, for which they are to be Honour'd, or that we ought to ask any thing of them, or that we ought to put our truſt in Pictures, as the</hi> Gentiles <hi>did, who plac'd their hope in Idols; but becauſe the Honour which is given to them, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Originals, which they repreſent: So that by Images which we kiſs, and afore which we take of our Hats and bow down, we Adore</hi> Chriſt <hi>and Worſhip the Saints, whoſe likeneſs they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us. And this is ratified by the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Nice, (<hi>Can.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 3, 4.) From Image Worſhip he comes to that of the Conſecrated Hoſt,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:175808:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſaies this is more intolerable, becauſe the Prieſt may forget the intention of Conſecrating, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly will not to Conſecrate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Of this Intention I ſpoke enough in the matter of Baptiſm and how hard it is for a Prieſt not to have a virtual one, ſuch as I explained there, and which ſuffices.</p>
                  <p>But if you ſuppoſe him to omit it maliciouſly, there will not be for that danger of Idolatty; for all Worſhip and Adoration given to the Hoſt, altho explicitly and formally, it be abſolute, yet virtually and implicitly it involves this condition: <hi>If it be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated:</hi> So if it be not conſecrated my adoration doeth not fix on it but goes to him whom I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adore, not to what I ſee, to wit, the ſpecies of Bread, and thus ther's no Idolatry commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it fals out often that he is thought the Father of a Child who really is not, did our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary doubt to reſpect him who was his Father? No more Reaſon have Catholicks to doubt to yield to the Holy Hoſt a Soveraign Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>For the reliques of Saints, becauſe we meet with many we know not whither they be authentick or not, our reſpect to them always involves in it this <hi>Tacit</hi> condition (of which above) if it be the true relique of ſuch a Saint.</p>
                  <p>As to that he ſayes 'tis not of Faith that the Soul of ſuch a Saint, for example, of St. <hi>Francis of Aſſiſium</hi> is in Heaven; I deny it, becauſe, altho' the Pope be not Infallible in his canonizing (as ſome Roman Catholicks hold) yet when his Decree is receiv'd by the acceptation of the whole Church, by their poſitive cult and Honouring of the Saint, its equivalent to the Decree of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He does not remark the difference which is between Interceſſion and Impetration:</p>
                  <p>Interceſſion preſuppoſes always a requeſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which is a Prayer, made to be preſented by the Interceſſion to God, (or to him from whom we intend to obtain a Favour,) to whom the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is made for the Client or Petitioner by the Interceſſor. Impetration not always, for a Favour may be obtained from the King for me, on which I did not ſo much as Dream. Thus you ſee our invocation of Saints as Interceſſors, does not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from God, becauſe it preſuppoſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made to be preſented by them to God.</p>
                  <p>Nay, nor from due Honour to Chriſt, ſince in all our Prayers in which the Church has her recourſe to Saints, in the <hi>Maſs</hi> or <hi>Breviary,</hi> after we have begun our Prayer by God, ſaying, <hi>O God,</hi> &amp;c. we always end <hi>per Dominum noſtrum Ieſum,</hi> &amp;c. deſiring that whatſomever we Pray for to be given
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175808:61"/>us from God by the Interceſſion of Saints, come to us through the Merits of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>So we only Pray them that they Pray, that what we demand may be given us through the Merits of Chriſt. And this way is ſo far from Diſhonouring Chriſt, that it Honours him more as he ſignified of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who thinking himſelf unworthy to approach Chriſt, immediatly made his approach firſt by his Friends whom he imagin'd more in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and 6. And Chriſt praiſed him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 10. For this Humility proceeding from the Faith he bad of the Grandour of his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>And if God had alwayes demanded our imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate recourſe to himſelf, he would not have ſent <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſaying, <hi>Go to my Servant</hi> Job, <hi>and my Servant</hi> Job <hi>will Pray for you, for him will I accept.</hi> Here you ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 7. that God would not hear <hi>Eliphaz</hi> who had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Are you, who reject the recourſe to Saints more Innocent afore God then <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was? Lay your Hand to your Heart: But why did God ſend <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob?</hi> Becauſe <hi>Iob</hi> had Honoured him, and God ſays, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. v.</hi> 30. <hi>who will have Honoured me, I will Honour him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for our Invoking the Name of <hi>Mary,</hi> is it leſs Holy then that of <hi>David?</hi> And yet did not <hi>Solomon</hi> Pray thus, <hi>for thy Servant</hi> David<hi>'s ſake turn not away the Face of thy Anointed, Pſalm.</hi> 132. <hi>v.</hi> 10? As if he had Pray'd God thus, <hi>O Lord who haſt ſaid, Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, a Zealous God, viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children into the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me.</hi> Thou haſt alſo ſaid <hi>vers</hi> 6. <hi>ſhowing Mercies unto thouſands of them that love and keep my Commandments.</hi> Thou then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:175808:61"/>who haſt mercy on Children for the Sainctity of their Parents, have mercy on me for my Fathers ſake.</p>
                  <p>What mean't <hi>Iacob Gen.</hi> 48 <hi>v.</hi> 14. when he bid his Name be call'd upon the Sons of <hi>Ioſepth,</hi> but that he expected God ſhould do them good upon that call for his ſake?</p>

                  <p>Note, in the old Teſtament they did not ſay as we do now to Saints pray for us, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not yet in Heaven nor ſaw God.

                  <p>I avow then we mind indeed ſick People invock Jeſus and Marry together, but in a different way Jeſus to ſave them, and <hi>Mary</hi> to Pray him for them.</p>
                  <p>If ſome ſimple People rely more on what they do then on what Chriſt did for them, 'tis not the Churches fault, tho' it may be the fault of ſome particular Paſtor neglecting the Inſtruction of his Flock.</p>

                  <p>The buſineſs our Adverſary drives at in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is this, that the Church incroaches upon the Temporal Dominions of Princes by depoſing Kings, untying their Subjects from their Allegiance to them, and giving their Lands to ſuch as can Conquer them. As may be ſeen in the third Chap. of the fourth General <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Let our Adverſary Read that Decree with the Eyes of a Divine, and he'l find that, that Decree is not of Faith, and therefore does not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blidge us to believe it.</p>
                  <p>The Decrees of Faith in that Council being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the firſt Chap. Intituled, <hi>de Fide Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica, The Tenets of the</hi> Catholick <hi>Faith.</hi> Let him then learn to diſtinguiſh another time a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Faith from a Decree of Precept. The firſt oblidges always and every where, the other not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways nor every where, but may be chang'd the circumſtances changing: As I ſaid when I told how a General Council may be mended.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſhow in this preſent Precept of the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third now ceaſing: For are <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> in <hi>France, Germany, England, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. admoniſh'd to take that Oath of Ridding their Lands of Hereticks? Or are they thought by the <hi>R. Church</hi> not good Catholicks, becauſe they do not do it?</p>
                  <p>Then you ſee this Oath may be omitted with a ſafe Conſcience, and Princes be without fear of having their Subjects free from their Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I ſay that under the general notion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:175808:63"/>of Potentats, Soveraigns are not comprehended, no more then Abbots under the General Name of Monks, tho' really they are Monks.</p>
                  <p>In fine, if you will not be ſatisfied with theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ſolutions, remember that the Embaſſadours of Kings were preſent at the Council, ſo that if they knew 'twas mean'd alſo of their Maſters, and they did not oppoſe the Decree afore it was paſſed <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti non ſit Injuria, no Injury is done to him who is willing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Decree I know is a common place for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> not conſidering that they hit themſelves on the Heel when they bring it againſt us, giving us an occaſion to reflect, not by a miſtake, but with Truth upon them, ſince the chief Principle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the firſt Beginers of their Reformation was, that it was Lawful not only to refuſe all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but to take Arms againſt their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Soveraign, for the Reformation of Religion. If they deny this Principle, as never ſuppoſed by their Predeceſſors, then they muſt grant that the firſt Broachers and Abettors of their Reformation were all Traytors and Rebels, ſince they begun it by Sedition and Rebellion againſt their Lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns in <hi>Germany, France, Geneva, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What was the great ground of the Bloody <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant? Have we not ſeen of late a number of Clowns and Crafts-Men by their private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Bible, free themſelves from all due Obedience to their King, and in their Conventicles endeavour to take from him all Royal Power by their ſeditious Sermons and Declarations, as in thoſe who were publiſhed at <hi>Sanchir</hi> and <hi>Rouglin?</hi> Many of which remain ſo obſtinate in their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſwaſions, that they will rather Dye, then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:175808:63"/>give any acknowledgment of ſubmiſſion to a moſt Gracious and Loving Prince.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay, they are not true <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I pray in what Fundamentals do they differ from you?</p>
                  <p>What a Childiſh Diſcourſe is this which follows, when he ſays that the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> forbids Her Followers the uſe of their Rational faculty to find out the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Why then does She propoſe to our Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to move it to Aſſent, or to be confirmed in that we have Aſſented to, marks out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Her being the true Church? Telling us firſt, that we ſee in Her, as was foretold, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. A perpetual and viſible Succeſſion of Paſtors, ſince the Apoſtles time, Is it credible, that God by a ſpecial Providence, notwithſtanding ſo many Perſecutions, would have Conſerv'd that perpetual Succeſſion of Paſtors, to teach Superſtition and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry? And not Conſerv'd a Succeſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors among <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to teach the true Religion? As we then have the ſame Spiritual Power ever Deſcending, and continued from the Apoſtles time, ſo have we alſo with it the ſame True and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctrine, Deſcending from Father to Son, ſince the Apoſtles time to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is no Doctrine or Faith now Preach'd to all Nations according to the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19. given to his Apoſtles, but that of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its altogether amazing, if the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine be true and Evangelical Doctrine, that GOD has never ſtirred up any of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Preachers to go with an Apoſtolical Spirit through Poverty, Afflictions, Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtles did, to inſtruct many Barbarous Nations in <hi>Africa, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:175808:64"/>America,</hi> but makes uſe only, to give the knowledge of his Holy Name to them, of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Superſtitious <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> the true Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtaying at Home with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That moreover this Faith and Doctrine, altho ſo Univerſal, yet all the Believers thereof have ſuch an Unity and Agreement among themſelves in matters of Faith. and ſuch a ſubordination to the viſible Head of the Church, that they make, as Chriſt ſaid of his Sheep, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16. one Flock and one viſible Paſtor, they both receiving all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light, Grace, and Direction, from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Head and Paſtor <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Doctrine of the <hi>R. Church,</hi> leads evidently to a Sanctity of Life, and Worſhip of God Almighty, by a Sacramental Confeſſion of Sins, Faſting, Praying, Self-denyal, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Fleſh, Good Works, keeping GODS Commandements, by Vows, the Holy Sacrifice of the Maſs, and many Ceremonies, by which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhow we make appear our inward reſpect to God.</p>
                  <p>From hence it comes that in all Ages among the Believers of the <hi>R. Church,</hi> there has appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and viſibly, to whole Nations Men of ſuch Sanctity of Life with the Gifts of Miracles, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deceaſe, their Lives and Miracles done both afore and after their Death, having been firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely examin'd and diſcus'd, and then approv'd, they were after this Examination declared Saints, and as ſuch, are for the preſent Honour'd by the whole <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. If you ſay, what is ſaid of thoſe Saints and their Miracles, is but Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p>Then I ask you, if a <hi>Iew</hi> would ſay the ſame
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:175808:64"/>to you of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Miracles. How would you convince him? For as he denyes the Divinity of CHRIST, ſo he denyes alſo the New Teſtament to be the Word of God. Laying then aſide Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, had Men at that time more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority to believe CHRIST's Miracles, then we have now to believe the approv'd Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Saints? From all I have ſaid, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the R. Church, notwithſtanding all theſe marks be not the true Church of CHRIST, he has no true Viſible Church upon Earth, ſince there cannot be more clear and Viſible Marks of the true Church, then theſe I have brought.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I infer that if the <hi>Iews</hi> ſeeing ſome Prophet's Sanctity of Life and Miracles, were moſt reaſonably perſwaded, and convinc'd, that GOD directed them by his Spirit, and ſpoke by their Mouths to others: We muſt of neceſſity believe that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is directed by the Spirit of GOD, and that He ſpeaks by Her to us: Since whatſomever motif you'l find for that perſwaſion in a ſingle Prophet, you will find it in an higher Degree in the whole Body of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now to make uſe of our rational faculty in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee if you have any appearance of a Church among you, 'tis not enough for you to ſay that the Proteſtant Church has the true Worſhip of God. You muſt bring ſuch proofs as I have brought for the R. Church to prove it. This you have never done nor will ever do.</p>
                  <p>But to come nigher to you, I ask by what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive you can perſwade me that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> your firſt Reformers were mov'd and directed by the Spirit of God in all their oppoſitions to the Roman Church?</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:175808:65"/>
                  <p>Can it be imagined that God would have taken from a whole viſible Church which had thoſe marks I ſpoke of, the true ſenſe and meaning of the word, and given it to Men who leaving the Altar and their Vow of Chaſtity proſtituted themſelves becoming the ſlaves of a ſhamful and Sacrilegious Paſſion?</p>
                  <p>As to that our Adverſary ſaies the Roman Church Impoſes many weighty burdens on her Children beyond what God Commands, he is mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; for God commanding us to Worſhip and obey him, he Commands us implicitly to make uſe of the means moſt convenient to perform theſe two duties.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church by her Commands does alſo but ſhow us the fitteſt means to perform the perfect obſervation of Gods explicit Command, and oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us to make uſe of them; and conſequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking there, is no new burden impos'd upon us.</p>

Having terrified the Chriſtians from Eating with the Gentils in their Solemnities a part of what was offer'd to the Idol; becauſe by this Eating they ſeem'd to approve the Oblation of that Fleſh made to the Devil; he told them nevertheleſs that they ſhould not be ſcrupulous to Buy what they found in the Shambles, nor to Eat what was ſet down before them to Eat at Common Tables out of thoſe Solemnities, altho' perchance thoſe Meats had been offer'd to Idols, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they being Ignorant of it, did not give occaſion to think they approv'd that Oblation to the Idol, in which onely the Sin was: But if, it fell out that one ſhould tell them that ſuch a

                  <p>Is not here ſomething refuſed to Eat altho' it be ſet down afore me to be Eaten, and altho' the thing be good in it ſelf ond belonging to God? Was not the forbidden fruit good in it ſelf, and yet was it Lawful for <hi>Adam</hi> to Eat it then with Thanks-giving when God had forbidden it? no more is it Lawful to us to Eat Fleſh which is good in it ſelf on Faſting dayes, becauſe it is then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Church of God which God will have us hear as himſelf <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Who hears you hears me.</hi> Has not the Church of <hi>England</hi> taken away that priveledge too, when ſhe commands to abſtain from Fleſh in Lent, or at leaſt from Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſull Meal till after noon or towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening on their dayes of Humiliation?</p>

                  <p>From that antecedent is this a good Inference, then, when I know I offend God by Tranſgreſſing the Command of his Church, and by Scandal of my Neighbour, I may Eat Fleſh, becauſe it is good in it ſelf, and at another time may be Eaten with Thanks-giving?</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> then bids Chriſtians not to ſcruple to buy or Eat Meat upon a fear that, it may be, 'twas offer'd to Idols; becauſe that reaſon did not make it unlawful to Eat, ſo I was not told of it.

So he would have a Biſhop to be the Husband of one Wife, or to have been only once Married.

                  <p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To thoſe who deſire to Marry, that they do not offer to Marry, when they know they are not free to Marry, being engag'd to others, or having an Impediment, and ſo make their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (when the Impediment is diſcover'd,) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable. However our <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cath. Text have neither <hi>is</hi> nor <hi>be;</hi> but <hi>Honourabile conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium in omnibus,</hi> Honourable Marriage in all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Greek Original Text.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, to juſtifie the Marriage of Church-Men who have Vow'd Chaſtity, he brings what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. v. 3. That <hi>forbiding to Marry is a Doctrine of Devils,</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Manicheans, Encratiſts</hi> and <hi>Marcioniſts,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that Cabal, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> remarks in his 12. <hi>Hom.</hi> upon that paſſage, it is quite another thing to forbid abſolutely to Marry, then to forbid only thoſe who have Vow'd Chaſtity to Marry.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Church does not forbid to Marry, but only forbids to break a Vow made to God. I think no Body will ſay that it is a Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, to fulfill what one has ſolemnly promiſed to God. The thing being Lawful in it ſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>When thou ſhalt Vow a Vow to the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlak to pay it, for the Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee.</hi> Now the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ſhows ſhe Honours Marriage more then <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe ſhe looks upon it as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not.</p>
                  <p>His inſtance of <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſayes nothing againſt us, for we do not deny, that the Prieſts of the Old Law Married, but only we ſay, they did not uſe their Wives thoſe dayes their turn was to Sacrifice, <hi>Luke c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. And ſeeing our Prieſts muſt Sacrifice every day, they ought to abſtain from that Action ſo remote from the Spirit, and dulling it in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:175808:69"/>order to Divine thoughts at that time that our mind ought to be <hi>(ſurſum corda)</hi> raiſed above our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hence <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hom.</hi> 23. <hi>in num. It ſeems to me that it belongs only to him to offer the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sacrifice, who has dedicated himſelf to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and perpetual Chaſtity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, his laſt paſſage is from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Let every Man have his own Wife,</hi> (had thoſe who were not defil'd with Women <hi>Rev</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 3. every one their own Wife?) makes nothing to prove that a Church-Man, who has made a Vow of Chaſtity may Marry, firſt, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Art thou looſen from a Wife ſeek not a Wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe there is no Woman who was his or the Church-Man's <hi>own</hi> Wife. To underſtand the meaning of this paſſage, you muſt know, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> asked St. <hi>Paul</hi> whither being converted they were not bound to leave their Wives, yet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, as ſome told them they ought to do, St. <hi>Hieron. L.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Iovin. cap.</hi> 4. To this St. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, <hi>no,</hi> but bids every one have his own Wife to whom he was Married in his Infidelity. He adds, <hi>let the Husband (viz.</hi> now converted) <hi>render his Debt to his Wife</hi> (tho' an Infidel) <hi>and the Wife al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> (Converted) <hi>mutually to the Husband</hi> (yet an Infidel.)</p>
                  <p>I would now deſire <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to reflect, that theſe paſſages brought by our Adverſaries to prove their Tenets have no force for their intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when they are read in their proper places, and in the aim of the Holy Writers in thoſe places; and ſo ſee how they are cheated, and impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their Teachers, when they are perſwaded by them, that the Word of God is againſt <hi>R.</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>OUr Adverſary ſaies, that the Gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency is preſuppoſed afore one make the Vow, ſo that if one find by Experience, that he has it not, he is obliged not to Vow; or if he has Vowed raſhly, flattering himſelf he had this Gift, he is no more engaged by his former Vow, but may in this caſe, nay perhaps is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſecure himſelf from Sin by a Lawful Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it being better in this conjuncture <hi>to Marry then Burne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, I retort the Argument thus. The Gift of conjugal Continency is equally preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the promiſe made in Marriage. May then a Man or Woman who find's by Experience in a ſhort abſence, or Sickneſs of the other party, that they have not that Gift, think themſelves free from their promiſe, and take another Wife or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer that thoſe Gifts are neither preſuppoſed to the one, nor to the other, but it is preſuppoſed that God will give thoſe Gifts to thoſe who ask them, or Grace to reſiſt Temptations as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:175808:70"/>often as they humbly demand it, after they have prudently engaged themſelves in either of thoſe States of Life. God gives indeed but to whom he pleaſes, but we know from his Word that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to none who ask it as they ſhould do, <hi>ask and it ſhall be given you, Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>God is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to be tempted above that you are able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis obſervable ſaies our Adverſary, that the moſt part that enter Religious Orders, make their Vows ſo young that they hardly reflect on what they are doing, many are forced by their Parents, or enter upon the account of Humane reſpect or intereſt, <hi>Ieſuits</hi> renew their Vows twice a Year, but 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their Lips, not from their Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, I retort the Argument thus. Many Marry ſo Young (nay far Younger than 'tis allow'd to make Religious Vows) that they ſcarce know what they are doing; many are forc'd by their Parents, or induc'd by the condition of their Affairs. May all thoſe at the firſt occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Marriages and make others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, that none can make the Vows of Religion afore they be full fixteen Years of Age; a Woman may Marry at thirteen, they have a Year of Ptobation or Tryal (the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> have two,) in this they are queſtioned in private whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not they were forc'd, which, if found, they are free to return to their former Condition. alſo after they have made their Vows, they have a determinated time allowed to them by the Church, in which they may reclaim, and return to their freedom: But if there be ſome found, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their Compulſion all the time of their Tryal, and neither vent it afore or after their ſolemn Vows in the time preſcribed them by the Church; they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:175808:70"/>are to be condemned, not the Nature of Vows; or Church, who behaves Her ſelf ſo Warily, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; and Sweetly with Her Children.</p>
                  <p>As to that he ſaies, the moſt of Religious are ſo forc'd, I am confident I can deny it with more ground than he aſſerts it. And if he knew one, who among the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> renewed his Vows onely with his Lips, and not with his Hart, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with that certain knowledge, and not judge raſhly that all the reſt do the ſame.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>The three Religious Vows of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chaſtity, and Obedience, are Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUr Adverſary admires why theſe three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Vows are called Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, becauſe, he ſaies, he never read in the Evangils, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> perſwaded Men to make thoſe Vows, he confeſſes CHRIST Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled a Young Nan to Sell all be had, and give it to the Poor, but not to make a Vow to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That he may then underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe Evangelical Counſels, he muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh three things. The uſe of a thing; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a thing, or Maſterſhip of it; and the Capacity of Dominion, or of being Maſter of it. For there are ſome, who altho' they be Maſters of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:175808:71"/>a thing, they have not the uſe of it. There are others who altho' they neither have the uſe of a thing nor are Maſters of it, yet they may become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it, <hi>to wit,</hi> if the ſaid thing be given them, or Sold to them.</p>
                  <p>This being ſuppoſed, I prove that the three Vows we ſpeak of are Evangelical Counſels, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life wiſhed to ſome Men in the Goſpel, and not Commanded. The Goſpel wiſhes to ſome Men what is more perfect in a Chriſtian Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what is leſs perfect. This propoſition ſtands alone, I need not prove it: But 'tis more perfect to make thoſe three Vows, than not to make them: Then the Goſpel wiſhes that ſome Men make them. This inclination in CHRIST, that at leaſt ſome of his followers embrace a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Life, is to inlightned Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>owerful perſwaſion, and found in the Goſpel; then 'tis a Goſpel Perſwaſion or an Evangelical Counſel.</p>
                  <p>Now that it is more perfect to make thoſe three Vows, than not to make any Vow. I prove firſt from God's approbation of Vows made by the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites, Num.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the common apprehenſion of Men, ſinding themſelves in an extream great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death, as in an extraordinary Storm at Sea, who are wont to implore the Divine aſſiſtance, by making a Vow to do ſomething more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to Honour him. This nature ſuggeſts to them as a thing moſt grateful to God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they Judge it more perfect, then not to make it. Did not <hi>Hannah</hi> think ſhe did a thing more pleaſing to God to Vow, then not to Vow? 1 <hi>Sam. v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Proof. 'Tis more perfect to deprive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:175808:71"/>one ſelf for the Love of God of many things, then only of few: But who makes theſe Vows, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives. himſelf of the Uſe, Dominion, and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being Maſter of Riches, otherwiſe Lawful Pleaſures, and ones one Will. Then he deprives himſelf for the Love of God by thoſe Vows of more things, then if he did not make them. Beſides, 'tis a greater Gift to give the Tree with the Fruit, which the Religious Man does, then the Fruit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>A third Proof. A thing ſhown and praiſed in the Goſpel, and not Commanded, is an Evangelical Counſel: But Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience, are ſhown to us in the Goſpel, praiſed, and not Commanded: Then they are Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay, I avow, that theſe three things are praiſed in the Goſpel and not Commanded, and that <hi>CHRIST</hi> practiſed them, but where find you that <hi>Chriſt</hi> made a Vow himſelf, or moved any other to Vow them? Eſpecially, ſince the Vow broken, charges the Breaker with a double guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſwaded Poverty, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. in theſe Words, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, Sell all thou haſt, and give it to the Poor.</hi> He perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that relinguiſhment of Goods which ſhould make a Man perfect: But that exterior abdicatition or leaving of Earthly Goods with a Will to repoſſeſs them again, does not make a Man perfect: But he ought to have an interior renouncing, or a Will not to acquire others in their place.</p>
                  <p>Neither had this Will compleated him in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, if this Will had been at his pleaſure and freedom freely revocable. Becauſe in that caſe this Young-Man of which the Goſpel ſpeaks, had not been fixed in the Service of God, yet with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:175808:72"/>by an Affection to, or care of theſe Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goods.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt then when he perſwaded that renouncing of Temporal Goods, which makes a Man perfect in the Service of God, he perſwaded a Vow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. If you ſay Chriſt embrac'd this Poverty in a moſt perfect manner without a Vow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Vow is not neceſſary for that end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> In Chriſt 'tis True, 'twas not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe he was determined to it, by the Beatifick Viſion, and had a Will that was not change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but a pure Man having a changeable Will, ſo that ſometimes, what he Wills to day he Wills not to morrow, he has need of a Vow to tye him to that which he now efficaciouſly Wills for the greater Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>The Vow of Obedience is Counſelled in the ſame Chapter and Verſe, in theſe Words, <hi>Follow me.</hi> Where Chriſt adviſes to a following which makes a Man perfect, but that is not the general way of following him, which all Chriſtians commonly take by an Obſervation only of the Commandements of God; which make in ſome ſenſe a perfect Man, but not in that ſublime and high perfection of which our Saviour ſpeaks here, when he ſayes, <hi>if thou wilt be perfect.</hi> &amp;c. then its a particular following. And whether then did Chriſt go? If to follow him be ſo high a perfection. To, and through all the Commands of his Father renouncing his own Will, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>made Obedient to Death, nay the Death of the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To follow Chriſt then, is to deſpoil ones ſelf of one's own Will, to be perfectly Subject and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to another, for the Love of God. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of Love to his Father, was perfectly Subject and Obedient to him. That then which Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:175808:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>by ſaying, <hi>follow me,</hi> was a renouncing for the Love of God, ſelf Will, a Subjection of it to that of another, and a perfect Obedience to Death.</p>
                  <p>The Vow of Chaſtity is ſeen perſwaded in theſe words, <hi>there are</hi> Eunuchs <hi>who have gelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Kingdom of Heaven Math.</hi> 19. (ſee what God promiſes to ſuch Spiritual <hi>Eunuchs Iſa</hi> 56. <hi>v.</hi> 4. and 5. <hi>ever unto them will I give in my Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a name better then of Sons and Daughters,</hi> for according to the common Opinion of Divines, they are to be underſtood of a Vow of Chaſtity, and with great Reaſon, for ſince gelding takes away, both Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you ſay, Chriſt did not perſwade that ſort of gelding, but onely made it known. I Anſwer, his adding who can take, let him take, was tho' not a Precept, yet an Exhortation to it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſince all the Goſpel, as to the part of it which regards manners, is a perpetual Inſtruction and Exhortation, this part runs in the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſt, and follows the nature of the whole. We diſcover by Chriſt's Words his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and his Inclinations are ſtrong perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to thoſe who are of the noble temper of well diſpoſed Souls.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer. Secondly</hi> did God put Man in a worſe condition by giving him the Law, then that in which he was afore he gave it him? Yet St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 7. did not know that Concupiſcence was a Sin without the Law, and ſo had not Sinned, committing it afore he knew the Law, and had Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if had committed it after.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer. Thirdly,</hi> who Sins againſt Chaſtity, having made a Vow of Chaſtity, is in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then he who commits the ſame not being under Vow, I grant, but the Vow does not make him Sin no more then the Law of God makes a Man Sin: Contrarywayes, it forbids him to Sin, with-draws him, and frights him from Sin more then the Law of God alone: So its by accident, that 'tis an occaſion of Sin; of it ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then he concluds with an applauſe to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive premiſſes, as he Imagins, thus, in what fears, if we have a timorous Conſcience, Troubles, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiles and Vexation of Spirit do we live?</p>
                  <p>He amplifies his concluſion by what he has heard ſome Religions ſay: that their burden was not like that of Chriſt Sweet and Light, but Bitter and moſt Heavy.</p>
                  <p>Hence, he further infers, that thoſe Vows are ſnares to entrap Souls, by which the Devil catches ſome who would not admit an open ſuggeſtion to Sin, by giving ſcope to follow their own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to make Vows, which being above their frailty, weary to ſwim alwiſe againſt Water at laſt they yield to the Stream, and go down-wards, which was the Devils deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> What does <hi>Hicr. Platus</hi> for the moſt part in that Treaty of the Good of a Religious Life exhort unto but what the ancient Philoſophers <hi>Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> &amp;c. diſcovered by the Light of Nature, to wit, that the happineſs of Man here upon Earth was to live a Life removed from Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Covetouſneſs of Riches, and other Cares, which might with-draw his Spirit from pleaſing the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods (as the Heathens ſpoke) acquiring Vertues and overcoming Paſſions; by which ſtudy his mind might be raiſed above all that is feared or loved in Human things, and ſo diſpoſe himſelf by a diſſipation of Clouds that riſe from Human Affections, to a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:175808:74"/>clear Contemplation of the moſt perfect being which is intelligible or knowable, I mean God in which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tho' not a Chriſtian, places the Felicity of Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer. Secondly,</hi> If <hi>Hier. Platus</hi> promiſed a ſingular Contentment to thoſe who leave for God's ſake all the goods which flatter the Hearts of worldly Men; did not our Saviour promiſe as much afore him, when he ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Amen, I ſay unto you there is no Man that hath left Houſe, or Parents, or Brethren, or Wife, or Children, for the Kingdom of God,</hi> (how do you underſtand that?) <hi>and ſhall not receive much more in this time, and in the World to come Life everlaſting.</hi> I lived with a Religious Man, who ſaid upon this Diſcourſe, he ſaw the Truth of the firſt part clearly, he only expected the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Let my Adverſary give me leave to tell him from St. <hi>Paul, animalis homo non percipit ea quae ſunt Spiritus Dei,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. a ſenſual Man is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the things of God, nor underſtands the ways of his Spirit, <hi>they are a folly to him:</hi> Thoſe things which are great helps to advance in Spirit, ſeem to him impediments of Perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> calling thoſe who were under Burden, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 29. and promiſing to eaſe them, bids them take moreover his Yoke on them, and tells them that by that means they ſhall find eaſe. This ſeems a Paradox, an odd thing to a ſenſual Man, who looſes the Yoke from the Neck of his Oxen when he has mind to eaſe them.</p>
                  <p>Little knows he for want of Experience, that this more particular Yoke of Chriſt, I mean his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Counſels put in practiſe, are to a good Religious Man, what the Wings are to an Eagle, they weigh indeed ſomething, but are ſo far from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:175808:75"/>weighing him down, that they help him to raiſe himſelf in the Air, and reach his Prey, which he could not do without them.</p>
                  <p>If the diminiſhing of Laws and Commands, for which our Adverſary is ſo great a Stickler, makes the way ſmoother and ſtraighter to Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; then the Law of Nature was the moſt advancing Law to Perfection of the three, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it far afore the written Law, and that of Grace.

                     <p>Religious Orders have many Rules I grant, but they are all reduc'd to three Heads, the keeping of Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience. As the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws of Kings and Countries are ſubdivided in a number of particular Obſervations. Neither is it true that a Rule cannot be ſcarce broken without Scandal or Contempt of Authority. For when the Bell in a Religious Community Rings a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour afore Dinner, to make the Examen of Conſcience, a Religious Man reflects that he has a Letter of Importance, that muſt be ſent to the Poſt at their riſing from Table, he Writes his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the time of the Examen, thinking it pleaſes God he do ſo; the Rule is brok without Scandal, Contempt, or Sin, in that caſe: This and ſuch like, we call defects not culpable, or breaches of the Rule without Guilt.</p>
                     <p>When we ſay, <hi>non progredi,</hi> is <hi>regredi, not to go forward,</hi> is <hi>to go back,</hi> we don't mean as our Adverſary miſtakes, that he who keeps the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God and his Church onely, goes backward, no, we think he goes forward, for the new obſervance of every Command, is a new ſtep to Perfection, but that as a Boat can't ſtand or flote upon a Currant, but muſt either bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tyde, or muſt be carryed down with the Stream; ſo we muſt never ſtop in the way of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſaying with that Fooliſh Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 19. my S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our Adverſary needs not ask in what pain and trouble Religious, who are of a timerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, live under the burden of ſome Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe that with the Grace of God they can keep them all, and feel ſo much eaſe in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that many undertake far more than the Rule preſcribes. <hi>Facile equitat quem Gratia Dei portat, he Rides at eaſe who is carried by the Grace of God,</hi> ſaies the following of CHRIST. But he ſhould ask in what pain <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, who think the leaſt Deviation from the Law by an idle word is a grievous Sin, and worthy Hell Fire; and who believe, that with all the Grace of CHRIST they cannot keep themſelves from making Damnable breaches of the Law of God. In what pain and anxiety of mind ought they to live?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe, who told our Adverſary that their Yoke was bitter, had not merited by their negligence to feel that inward Unction of which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks nor taſted of that Water of which our Saviour to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, but living in Religion, and breathing ſtill after the World, as ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> not taſting with the Good, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Manna,</hi> Hungred after the Fleſh-Pots of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> So ſuffering within themſelves a perpetual Combat between Nature and Grace, the one draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and the other to the World; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Burden was not like that of CHRIST, Sweet and Light, but heavy and unpleaſant by their own Fault.</p>
                     <p>If the Devel thought to inſnare Men by giving way to their inclination of making Vows, he may now leave of (as being deceived) by a ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to himſelf ſeeing thouſands by the daily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Vow, gain ſignal Victories over him; eſpecially, if he be more gal'd by the eminent
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:175808:76"/>Sanctity and Elevation of one far inferiour in nature to him, than pleaſed in the fall of many, who deſpoiled of Grace are not conſiderable in reſpect of him. But deceiv'd, he is not in giving way to the Miniſters common Exhortations to the People to keep the Commandement of God, by a practical horror of Sin, and embracing of Vertue. For when on one ſide, the Miniſter threatens them with a heavy Judgement, if they don't live a good Life, and on the other, tells them 'tis impoſſible to live ſo and walk in the Commandements of God; is not this to diſtract a Man, or caſt him looſe, and after he was wearied himſelf, ſtriving againſt the Tyde of his corrupted Nature, make him yield to the Stream of Sin, impoſſible to bear up againſt it, and ſo go down-wards? Which was in our Adverſaries own Words the Enemies ſole aim and main deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have a more rational and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thought of the goodneſs of God. <hi>Who Wills the end,</hi> ſais the maxime in moral philoſophy, <hi>affords means to attain it;</hi> God Wills we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, will he not afford us Grace with which we may, and without which we cannot keep them? If Men who are wicked give good things to their Children, will he refuſe the good Spirit to thoſe who ask it of him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 13. will he leave Men without Grace, who have left all for the pure love of him? No, <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> find the Truth of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> ſaying, <hi>God is Faithful and will not ſuffer us to be Tempted beyond our force,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>but will make us find advantage in the Temptation.</hi> and that they can do all in him who comforts them, <hi>ad Philip.</hi> 4. no, there is no Sin or Temptation that Grace can not overcome, nor Grace neceſſary for our Salvation which Prayer can not obtain, and a

                     <p>Men need not fear to undertake prudently to do for God, he will ſtill out do them.

You ſee there are ſome Sins Guilty of Hell, others not Guilty of Heil Fire, and ſuch Sins we call Venial, call them as you pleaſe, ſo you diſtinguiſh them from failings, depriving Men of the Friendſhip of GOD. But this does not open the Door to looſneſs, for the reaſon I brought in my third Anſwer. but the denying of this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, opens the Door to a perpetual diſturbance of mind, dread and fear in a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> of Dying ſuddenly (as many Dye) after he has ſpoken an idle Word; for this idle Word, according to our Adverſary, is a Damnable breach of the Law of GOD, and deſerves his Eternal Wrath, as being of an illimated Malice, as he ſpeaks, and can't be forgiven in the other World; but muſt be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here under pain of Damnation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 5.

            <head>ANSWER TO THE POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Reduce the ſubſtance of what our Adverſary in his ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſaies to the Reader, and in his <hi>Poſt-Script,</hi> to 6. Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and add to every one its Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He has changed his Title and calls now his Book <hi>Proteſtancy proved ſafer than Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Then Popery is ſafe, for the quality which is found in the comparative is alſo in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, tho' in a meaner Degree.</p>
            <p>Hence, in his Opinion to Live and Dye in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (as he thinks we <hi>Catholicks</hi> do) is a ſafe way to Salvation. Let the Reader conſider to what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity our Adverſary brings himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaies his Book is a new Method, becauſe the Methods hitherto made uſe of by Learned <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> for the Eſtabliſhment of Proteſtancy, have been <hi>for the moſt part negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:175808:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All thoſe Learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who have endeavoured to prove that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion is conform to the Word of GOD, did not they endeavour to prove, not negatively, but poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may be ſaved? How then does he ſteer another Courſe (as he terms it) than they? How is his Method New? When he ſayes, <hi>for the moſt part</hi> the Learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> took the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative way of proving Proteſtancy, he as good as avows, that a part of them took the poſitive way, and therefore in that his Method is not New.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſayes his Method <hi>is Infallible in this ſenſe, that it contains ſuch Arguments, that nothing but meer obſtinacy can hinder any underſtanding to yield to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Is it meer obſtinacy that hinders our underſtanding to yield, when we have as clear Scripture for the Infallibility of the Teaching Church, as he has for the chief Articles of his Faith, as that of the B. Trinity, Incarnation, and Juſtification by Faith only? See <hi>Pag.</hi> 38. When we have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Tradition? When we have a ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as this which follows?</p>
            <div type="reason">
               <head>A Reaſon. <hi>To prove the neceſſity of an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Viſible Guide.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT belongs to the infinite goodneſs of God, and his ſpecial Love to Man above all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not to leave him in an extream per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity for his Salvation, and that unavoidable.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:175808:83"/>But if Man be left every one to his own particular Judgment in every particular Article of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Infallible Viſible Guide, he can't but be in an extream perplexity for his Salvation, and that unavoidable: Then God has not left Man without an Infallible Viſible Guide.</p>
               <p>I prove the minor, becauſe, the reſolution of our doubts is in matters moſt obſcure, and unfind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with certainty by the beſt of Wits and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt of Conſciences, as the Myſtery of the B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Incarnation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then I can't but be in an extream perplexity, whether I am right or wrong in my <hi>private diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> what I ought to believe in theſe matters.</p>
               <p>For, ſhall I preſumptuouſly think I am right in my Opinion of Religion, when I ſee my ſelf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a World of others as witty in their thoughts as I, and as Moral in their Actions? Or ſhall I out of Humility leave my Opinion to joyn with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? But he (without an Infallible Viſible Guide,) can give me no more aſſurance for his Opinion, than I could have given him for mine. So I am where I was, in a perplexity. Whatever way I turn my ſelf, I am oppreſſed with a dreadful and juſt fear of not hitting upon the right way of Salvation; with a juſt fear of not falling upon the true ſenſe of the H. Scriptures, and if I miſtake, I miſtake to my Eternal Damnation.</p>
               <p>If I am right in my Faith (ſince there is only one true Faith) all who do not joyn with me are wrong; and if one of my Oppoſers be right, I, and all who oppoſe him ate wrong, and ſo thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſincerely following their own Judgement, may be Damned.</p>
               <p>This does not ſtand with the ſpecial Love of God to Man, but it belongs to his infinite goodneſs to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:175808:84"/>give us ſo ſure a Guide, that ſimple People, or <hi>Fools</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, c. 35.) as well as the Learned, following this Guide may not Err. This Guide is the Teaching Church to which God has given ſuch Teſtimonies, <hi>Teſtimonia tua credibilia facta ſunt nimis, Pſal</hi> 92. of its being evidently credible to all that he ſpeaks to Men by Her, that the meaner Capacities laying aſide Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Temporal Intereſt cannot but ſee 'tis She, he will have us hear for our Spiritual Direction. The motives of Credibility move my Judgment to bring me to Her, but being brought to Her, I do not believe for my Judgment, but for the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, who I ſee ſpeaks by Her. As when you bring to me a Man who ſpeaks Divinely of God, I carry him Veneration, mov'd to it not by your bringing of him, but by the worth and gift of God, which I diſcover in the Man: So my Judgments bringing me to the Church, is a meer mental approximation, as your bringing that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Man to me, or Wood to the Fire is a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal one, both meer conditions, <hi>ſine quibus non,</hi> having no poſitive influence on my aſſent, or the effect. This Judgment of mine, God will have, becauſe I muſt Work like a Man, and not like an inſenſible Agent which is brought, as Fire, to the Subject it muſt burn or Work upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſaies, that theſe propoſitions <hi>Proteſtants may be ſaved. And that they may be ſaved more eaſily and with greater ſecurity than</hi> Romaniſts, <hi>are ſelf evident Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Why then does he ſo buſie himſelf to prove them? Who undertakes to prove that the whole is greater then each part of it? Why not? becauſe its a ſelf evident Principle which needs no Proof.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:175808:84"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Infallibility of the</hi> Church, <hi>tho' it may have ſome Degree of Probability, is not an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Divine Faith.</hi> Becauſe, faies he, its neither clearly ſet down in Scripture, nor defined by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He muſt be very Ignorant of <hi>Catholick</hi> Principles, or willing to appear ſo, who does not know that Apoſtolical Tradition is enough to make to us an Article of Faith, without Scripture or the Decree of a General Council.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that Infants and Young Children are to be Baptized, is the third propoſition of the 27. Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Can he prove me that by clear Scripture? I am ſure he can't. Is it not an Article of Faith, that 'tis unlawful to Rebaptize? Where is that ſet down in clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Articles of Faith, ſayes he, are thoſe Points which are agreed upon by all true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If thoſe points be Articles of Faith, which are agreed upon by all true Chriſtians. Then that is not an Article of Faith on which all true Chriſtians do not agree: Then 'tis not an Article of Faith to our Adverſary, that we are juſtified by Faith only, becauſe, ſome true Chriſtians deny it. Yet it is the 11. Article of the 39. of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
